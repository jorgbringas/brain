# Fury Program

The Fury program is designed for individuals with high active learning and deep processing, but weaknesses in revision strategy. The name is inspired by Nick Fury from Marvel, who is a high-functioning operator with an eyepatch. The eyepatch represents the blind spot that Fury students tend to have. Furies are one of the rarest types and are held back by gaps in their overall system.

Fury students are usually top level achievers already, often nationally ranked. These students benefit the most from optimisation of their overall system, developing strong systems of self-reflection and self-optimisation, and bulletproof revision systems that prepare them for the most difficult knowledge applications or exams.

## TYPICAL PROGRESS FOR FURIES

Fury students reap large rewards from big-picture system-wide techniques that expose key gaps in their studying strategies. When these strategies are refined, they can often refine them relatively quickly, leading to an early plateau of marginal gains. When advanced techniques are introduced, existing system can be upgraded and consolidated to reach the next level of improvement.

# Fury Program Overview

Fury students are the easiest students to accommodate for due to the relative lack of weaknesses. Progress can be fairly flexible as long as key fundamentals are not missed. The Fury program quickly reviews the fundamentals, introduces strong reflective practice early on and moves through the course in "sprints" of theory, followed by extended periods of consolidation. Fury students are the only type of student who can progress in sprints safely. This is only possible as deep processing and active learning are already well developed, which is not the case for other students.

## Characteristic Fury Features

### THE BLIND SPOT

Results are usually exceptional, however when mistakes are made, they can seem unpredictable. In some cases, this can lead to anxiety and confusion for the student, who can be unsure how to prevent similar mistakes in the future.

### ADVANTAGES

*   Minimal deep processing and active learning limitation. Deep processing limitations may still manifest in advanced level of techniques, depending on baseline.

### DISADVANTAGES

*   Potential for selective learning and skipping key components of the technique due to overconfidence.

# Recommended Strategy Guidelines

These guidelines have been developed to help you transition to our techniques as smoothly as possible, avoiding the common mistakes that similar students often face.

| Main Guideline               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Key Insight / Reminder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Be meticulous**            | You're probably used to racing through things very quickly. But when we're looking for gaps in your system, this is not an efficient approach. It's better to carefully examine each new technique you learn and immediately experiment with it. Avoid selective learning. | *Fury students commonly remark on how they only realised why something was important months after learning about it. Keep this in mind.*                                                                                                                                |
| **Reflect critically and often** | Your greatest asset will be your ability to coach yourself. Be highly systematic in your reflection and constantly seek marginal gains at every step.                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Engage with feedback**     | The worst (and saddest) reason a Fury student does not succeed long-term is overconfidence or underutilisation of resources and expertise. Reach out to peers and experts. A student who has had 6 months more experience through the course than you can give you insights that can save you months of trial and error! | *Students commonly underestimate how deep some of these techniques can go. Some students choose to restart the entire course after 3 or 4 months because they realise they had been learning too superficially before.*                                           |

After the 30-day program, stay at the Technique Training stage until reliable feedback consistently validates your technique. Focus on lots of practice and frequent application of Kolb's cycle during this time. At most, do not proceed into Ascent 2.
