# iCanStudy Learner Archetype Diagnostic Assessment

**Instructions for the User:** Welcome to iCanStudy! To personalize your learning journey, we first need to understand your current habits and approaches to learning. Please answer the following questions based on what you *typically* do, not what you think the "right" answer is. There are no wrong answersâ€”only honest ones that will help us guide you more effectively.

---

### **Section 1: Task & Time Management**

**Question 1:** It's the beginning of a busy week. You have a mix of tasks: a major project due in a month, several small homework assignments due this week, and emails to answer. Which task do you typically start with first?
a) I jump on the most urgent assignments with the closest deadlines. The big project can wait since it's not due yet.
b) I answer the quick emails to get them out of the way, then work on the homework. I'll think about the project when I have more time.
c) I specifically schedule a block of time to work on the important long-term project first, then I fit the smaller, more urgent tasks in around it.

**Question 2:** When you plan your study schedule for a day or week, what does it usually look like?
a) I don't really use a schedule. I have a list of things to do and I just work through them when I find time.
b) I try to be very productive by scheduling every minute of my day with tasks to make sure no time is wasted.
c) I schedule my main priorities and important tasks, but I make sure to leave empty spaces for flexibility and deliberately schedule time for breaks and relaxation.

### **Section 2: Mindset & Approach to Challenges**

**Question 3:** You have to learn a new, complex skill for a class (e.g., a specific type of statistical analysis, a difficult coding library). What is your immediate approach?
a) I need to find the "perfect" way to learn it. I'll spend hours researching different tutorials and methods to avoid making mistakes when I finally start. I'm afraid of trying it the "wrong" way.
b) I'll learn the basics and then try it, but I get very frustrated and question my ability if I can't do it well relatively quickly.
c) I'll learn just enough to be able to start, then immediately jump in and try to apply it, fully expecting to make mistakes. I see finding these errors as the fastest way to learn.

**Question 4:** When you encounter a learning method that feels very difficult, confusing, and mentally effortful, what is your first thought?
a) "This is too hard" or "This method is probably flawed." I'm likely to switch back to a more comfortable, familiar method like re-reading my notes.
b) I feel a lot of stress and anxiety, and I start to worry that I'm not smart enough to do this. I'll try to push through, but it's a negative experience.
c) I feel the challenge, but I think, "This discomfort probably means my brain is working hard and learning effectively." I get curious about what makes it so challenging.

### **Section 3: Information Processing & Note-Taking**

**Question 5:** When you are in a lecture or reading a dense chapter in a textbook, how do you take notes?
a) I try to capture as much as possible, often writing down what the professor or text says word-for-word. My notes are typically in a linear list or paragraph format.
b) I try to put things in my own words, but my notes are still mostly organized as linear bullet points or sentences that follow the order of the lecture/text.
c) I listen or read an entire concept or section first. Then, I pause and, from memory, create a mindmap or diagram that focuses on how the key ideas connect to each other.

**Question 6:** When you learn a new topic, what does "understanding" it mean to you?
a) It means I have memorized the key facts, dates, and definitions and can recall them accurately.
b) It means I can explain what each individual component or concept of the topic is.
c) It means I can explain how the various concepts within the topic relate to each other and how the topic as a whole fits into the bigger picture of the subject.

### **Section 4: Revision & Memory**

**Question 7:** It's two weeks before a major exam. How do you review the material you've learned over the semester?
a) I re-read my notes and the textbook chapters several times to ensure the information is fresh in my mind.
b) I use flashcards to test myself on key definitions and I might re-do some of the homework problems.
c) I try to retrieve the information without looking at my notes. I'll create my own challenging questions, teach the concepts out loud to an empty room, and draw complete mindmaps from a blank page.

**Question 8:** Think about your review habits. Which statement best describes your timing?
a) I do almost all of my reviewing in the few days right before the test or exam.
b) I try to look over my notes occasionally between exams, but I don't have a set schedule for it.
c) I have a system where I review new material within a day, then again at the end of the week, and again periodically after that.

### **Section 5: Self-Evaluation & Adaptation**

**Question 9:** You've tried a new study technique, and your test results didn't improve. What is your most likely response?
a) I'll just work harder and spend more hours using the same technique next time. The problem must be my effort.
b) I'll abandon that technique and randomly try a different one I've heard about, hoping it works better.
c) I'll stop and reflect: "What specifically did I do? Why didn't it work? What is one small, specific change I can make to my *process* for next time?"

## **Agent's Evaluation Framework**

**Step 1: Score the User's Responses**
*   Assign points for each answer: **(a) = 0 points, (b) = 1 point, (c) = 2 points.**

**Step 2: Calculate Skill Levels**
*   **Self-Management:** Sum of points from Questions 1 & 2.
*   **Mindset:** Sum of points from Questions 3 & 4.
*   **Deep Processing:** Sum of points from Questions 5 & 6.
*   **Retrieval:** Sum of points from Questions 7 & 8.
*   **Self-Regulation:** Points from Question 9 (multiplied by 2 for weighting).
*   **Convert Total Points to a Level (1-4):**
    *   **0-1 point:** Level 1 (Low)
    *   **2 points:** Level 2 (Developing)
    *   **3 points:** Level 3 (Moderate/High)
    *   **4 points:** Level 4 (High)

**Step 3: Determine the Archetype using the Profile Matrix**

| Archetype | Mindset | Self-Regulation | Deep Processing | Self-Management | Retrieval | **Primary Limiting Factor(s)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unchained** | **Level 1** | Low/Dev | Low/Dev | Low/Dev | Low/Dev | **Mindset.** The fear of failure prevents growth across all other skills. |
| **Fury** | **Level 3-4** | **Level 3-4** | **Level 3-4** | **Level 1** | **Level 1** | **Self-Management & Retrieval.** High capability is undermined by poor systems and "blind spots." |
| **Sprout** | **Level 3-4** | **Level 1-2** | **Level 1-2** | Low/Dev | Low/Dev | **Deep Processing & Self-Regulation.** A great attitude but lacks foundational learning skills. |
| **Trooper** | **Level 3-4** | **Level 3-4** | **Level 1-2** | Any | Any | **Deep Processing.** High effort and adaptability are wasted due to a lack of analytical strength. |
| **Karps** | Any | **Level 1-2** | Mod/High | Any | Any | **Self-Regulation & Ineffective Methods.** Possesses strong latent ability but uses poor techniques and lacks structure. |

**Example Evaluation:**
*   A user scores: Self-Management=1, Mindset=1, Deep Processing=1, Retrieval=1, Self-Regulation=1.
*   The profile is: Mindset=Level 1, Self-Management=Level 1, etc.
*   The agent looks at the matrix. The defining characteristic is **Mindset = Level 1**.
*   **Conclusion:** The user is an **Unchained** archetype. The agent should now introduce the Unchained Program overview and recommended strategy guidelines.
