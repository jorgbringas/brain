# Unchained Program

The Unchained program is designed for individuals with lower mindset scores. Students in the Unchained program often have characteristics and personality attributes that strongly drive success, but are limited by competing beliefs or perspectives that prevent these attributes from flourishing.

As the name implies, this program is designed to remove the restrictions for these students so that they can truly thrive. Of all the student types, those in the Unchained program tend to experience the greatest challenge, but also the most dramatic transformation.

## TYPICAL PROGRESS FOR UNCHAINED

(Image of a graph with a y-axis representing progress and an x-axis with labels: Mindset restricted, Transformation in thinking, Stabilisation, Unchained)

Unchained students are restricted by mindset. This can often be traced back to childhood experiences where grades or results were heavily prioritised. In some cases, self-worth or parental approval is linked to performance outcomes. The internalised pressure to "not fail" can create visceral fear avoidance, shying away from challenges, personal insecurity, and an unwillingness to experiment. As experimentation is necessary for growth, this means that until certain perspectives are unlocked, all new techniques will inevitably fail. Over years of working with students with limiting mindsets, we were surprised to learn that when these students are able to persevere through the early stages and learn to think in new ways, their results can sometimes surpass that of any other student. This "trial by fire" phenomenon seems to be unavoidable.

# Unchained Program Overview

We now recognise that Unchained students have massive potential. They have often exerted more effort, suffered more stress, more uncertainty and more anxiety than other students. These create the fire. The missing component is a method of converting all of these experiences and emotions into fuel for growth and transformation. On review of the research, as well as our own extensive experience, we have identified the following components as critical for success:

1.  Clear and explicit safety nets
2.  Inclusive and empowering community (and engagement in this community)
3.  Counterintuitively, early struggle and difficulty is correlated to higher success, while highly specific direction and instruction creates worse outcomes (making the early stages overly guided has been shown to create a higher risk of failure medium to long-term as students do not learn to manage the difficulties when it is relatively easy)
4.  Accessible and reliable support

Fortunately, we have found that when all of these guidelines are followed, the chance of success is very high.

## Characteristic Unchained Features

### AVERSION TO EXPERIMENTATION

One of the core, unescapable requirements for success is to accept and expect failure. It is logically impossible to improve any meaningful skill without experiencing failure. When we are engaging in rapid growth, it is necessary to experiment at a high frequency (potentially multiple times per day), which means lots of failures, very often. Accepting that every experiment is more likely to fail than succeed is crucial to learning and growing. When failure is avoided, growth is avoided.

This is an incredibly hard pill to swallow, emotionally and mentally. For this reason, we will do our best to support and guide you through this process, helping you transform your skills and free yourself from the never-ending spiral of "what if". Remember, we're right by your side.

### ADVANTAGES

*   Massive growth potential once mindsets are changed.
*   Dramatic improvements in mental health and learning skill (proportionately greater than any other student type, by far)

### DISADVANTAGES

*   Emotionally difficult to commit to change.
*   Time and energy consuming to create the change.

# Recommended Strategy Guidelines

These guidelines have been developed to help you transition to our techniques as smoothly as possible, avoiding the common mistakes that similar students often face.

| Main Guideline           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Key Insight / Reminder                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Focus on the process** | Not every attempt will result in success. And almost every attempt will feel rather uncomfortable! These are all normal parts of the growth process. Even if you aren't able to see yourself improving, you can rely on others (peers and experts) to give you feedback to help you see how you can optimise your process. It might take 100 failures for your first win. After that, you might win 99% of the time, but if you focus too much on each failure, instead of what you learned from it and how you can adapt your process to get 1% better each time, it will take longer and longer to tick off the 100 failures you need before you succeed. | *The worst thing you can do is not give something a go because you're afraid you won't be able to do it right. In this situation, you won't learn anything new (such as how not to do it), nor will you have actually succeeded at it. No matter what happens, you'll never know until you try!*                                                                                                                                              |
| **Celebrate the wins**   | It's easy to get bogged down in all the mistakes you're making. But for anyone learning a new skill, there will always be more things that were done wrong than were done right. Even the generation's greatest genius will be nothing in their first month compared to a master. Everyone has their own journey and their own timeline. It's important to stop and smell the roses, but you can't enjoy the smell if you're too occupied comparing your roses to your neighbours! | *Some of our **best** students were Unchained. They belittled their wins until they realised that they had long surpassed their peers. Celebrating your wins keeps you motivated, and who doesn't want that?*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Fail fast and fail often** | As we've mentioned, failing is going to be your new favourite activity! Get used to failing often on things that don't matter. This helps retrain the psychological barrier to experimentation. It could be as simple as being more decisive when looking at a menu, not worrying so much about how to greet someone, or changing the way you write notes in a small way. Even if you don't jump into the deep end of the fear zone, dip your toes every day. | *This is a method called graduated exposure therapy which is a standard form of brain retraining used by clinical psychologists.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

After the 30-day program, stay at the Technique Training stage until reliable feedback consistently validates your technique. Focus on lots of practice and frequent application of Kolb's cycle during this time.
