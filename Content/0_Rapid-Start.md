### **Sub-Module 0.1: Introduction to Rapid Start**

*   **Skill:** Mindset
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **The Purpose of Rapid Start:** Spending time to unblock our future barriers is crucial to learning new skills quickly. Unfortunately, it's a step that is often overlooked. As a result, learners can encounter more obstacles than needed. This can be frustrating and eventually demotivating as overcoming each obstacle takes time, energy, and attention away from making further strides.
    *   **Key Principle:** It's always worth investing time now to make things easier for yourself later. Your future self will have their hands full. Finding ways to make it easier for ourselves later means we give ourselves the space to adapt and overcome new and harder challenges. Removing obstacles early on allows rapid progress later.
    *   **The Theory-Practice Cycle:** In reality, practice is essential to give relevance to theory. Our questions become more targeted, and we can enter the theory-practice cycle, which is the engine for skill development. When the theory-practice cycle is delayed or infrequent, skill development is slow and ineffective.

### **Sub-Module 0.2: Rapid Time Management**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Urgency Trapping:** The tendency to focus on urgent tasks (with immediate deadlines) over important ones (which contribute to long-term goals).
    *   **Task Management vs. Time Management:** Task management is deciding *what* to do. Time management is *scheduling when* to do it.
    *   **Human Biological Tendencies:** Our brain is not inherently good at prioritizing for the modern, long-term. It is wired to react to what feels most urgent.
    *   **Urgency vs. Importance:** A task is **important** if the consequence of failure is unacceptable and unmanageable. A task is **urgent** if it demands immediate attention. The goal is to escape the stress of constant "fire-fighting" by prioritizing the important.
    *   **Theory Time vs. Practice Time:** Learning new skills requires significantly more practice time than theory time (e.g., a 5:1 ratio for practice:learning).
*   **Key Principle:** Always practice **often, early,** and with increasing **challenges.** Learning and time management are skills. And skills are about what you can **do,** not what you **know.** One of the most common reasons people struggle to acquire new skills is when there is too much theory and insufficient practice.
*   **Task: Fix Urgency Trapping**
    1.  Identify any tasks that take up a significant amount of your time because they are urgent but not necessarily important. Remember, a task is important if the consequence of failure is **unacceptable** and **unmanageable.**
    2.  Next, identify tasks that you know are important but not urgent. These tasks could make a big difference in the medium to long term. **Remember to include "learning to learn"!**
    3.  Set time in your schedule to work on the important, non-urgent tasks regularly. Your urgent tasks should fit around this.

### **Sub-Module 0.3: Rapid Google Calendar Tutorial**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **The Dangers of Overscheduling:** Many people pack their schedules too ambitiously because they have lots to do. Unfortunately, a full schedule means nothing if you cannot follow it. Overscheduling is problematic for multiple reasons:
        1.  It creates an illusion of productivity. What matters is what you completed, not what you scheduled.
        2.  It makes it harder to assess your true workload capacity. This makes it harder to gradually improve as you don't know where your limits truly are.
        3.  It makes planning more difficult because your ability to estimate how long it will take to complete tasks is inaccurate.
        4.  It creates the undesirable psychological impact of getting used to falling behind and struggling to catch up. This is not a positive mindset that fosters high-quality work and well-being.
    *   **Key Principle:** Schedules become useless when you cannot follow them. Always start by scheduling with a relaxed and manageable timing. Then, fit more tasks and events as your time management skills improve. Overscheduling reduces productivity while making improvement more difficult.
    *   **Make Time for Fun:** It's also essential to schedule relaxation and fun activities, especially when busy. The human brain is not a tireless machine. When we're busy, it's easy not to schedule relaxation time in our day because we want to get more things done. Unfortunately, this can have a detrimental effect. It can lead to more unintentional breaks in the form of procrastination, which ultimately causes us to fall behind on our schedule and makes us feel guilty. Over time, trying to adhere to an over-full schedule can contribute to burnout.
    *   **Key Principle:** Even the most productive people aren't machines. Schedule time for breaks and relaxation during busy days. This ensures we are rested, energised, and focused.
*   **Task: Schedule iCanStudy Theory**
    *   **Instructions:** Let's set up for success! Create a simple schedule for when you will cover theory through our iCanStudy program weekly or fortnightly.
    *   We recommend between 1 to 3 hours per week of theory. Remember that practice should happen by gradually replacing your existing methods with the new techniques you learn.
    *   If you spend more than 20 hours per week learning, you may be able to manage up to 5 hours per week of theory before risking overload.
    *   **When scheduling, remember to keep in mind:**
        *   Urgency trapping and why you should time-box important tasks (like upgrading your learning with our program)!
        *   The dangers of overscheduling. Keep your schedules easily manageable at first.

### **Sub-Module 0.4: Rapid Procrastination Tips**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management (Quick Wins)
*   **Introduction:** Here is a list of the techniques that you can do to prevent procrastination. See which of these techniques you are not using and try them out. Most of the things will be taught again later in the course and more advanced versions of it. This is just a list to kind of get you started.
*   **Anti-Procrastination Tips:**
    1.  **Make a List of Tasks: Break It Down.** When you feel like procrastinating, make a list of tasks. Breaking down an abstract task into smaller steps can make it seem a lot more doable, naturally reducing your urge to procrastinate.
    2.  **Set Yourself Up for Success.** Set yourself up. This means put away those distracting tabs, those windows on your computer, put your phone on silent, put it away, and also start to load up your work or get out your textbooks. You don't actually have to go and do it. You can set all of it up and then pack it up again and go back to procrastinating. But just by doing this, you may feel inclined to get some work done.
    3.  **Get Started Beforehand.** Get started beforehand. Allow those completionist and perfectionist tendencies to fight off that procrastination for you. Get started on some work the night before, even if it's just a few minutes. The point isn't to do it to a good standard, but the next day, knowing that you have this unfinished piece of work can be enough for you to get started instead of putting it off.
    4.  **Group Up: The Power of Social Focus.** Group up and find some friends to create a focus session. And sometimes that social pressure can actually be a good thing to get you going.
    5.  **Aim for Your Personal Best (Not Perfection).** Instead of aiming for perfect, aim for your personal best. Whether that mean the best usage of this technique that you're learning, the best effort that you've put into something, or the best time taken. Whatever it is, aim for a PB.
*   **Task: Action Plan - Goodbye Procrastination!**
    *   **Objective:** Start overcoming procrastination by applying at least ONE new technique TODAY on a pending task.
    *   **Do It NOW! (Next 15-30 minutes):**
        1.  **Identify YOUR "Procrastinatable" Task (1 minute):**
            *   Think of ONE specific thing you've been putting off. Write it down.
            *   *Example: "Start report X," "Study Chapter 3," "Tidy my desk."*
        2.  **Choose YOUR Starting Technique (1 minute):**
            *   From the lesson's list, pick ONLY ONE to start.
                *   Make a List (Break It Down)
                *   Set Yourself Up
                *   Get Started Beforehand (Mini-Advance)
                *   Group Up
                *   Personal Best (Not Perfection)
        3.  **ACTION! Apply Your Chosen Technique (5-20 minutes):**
            *   **If you chose "Make a List":** RIGHT NOW: Take your task and break it into 3-5 super small, concrete steps. Write them down. *E.g., "Study Chapter 3" -> "1. Open book to Ch. 3," "2. Read the first subtitle," "3. Summarize the first paragraph in one sentence."* **BONUS:** Do the very first micro-step on your list NOW!
            *   **If you chose "Set Yourself Up":** RIGHT NOW: Close ALL browser tabs you don't need. Put your phone on silent and OUT OF SIGHT. Open only the documents you DO need. If it's a physical task, clear your immediate workspace. **BONUS:** Once set up, dedicate just 5 minutes to the task.
        4.  **Quick Reflection (1 minute after the action):**
            *   How did you feel applying the technique?
            *   Was it easier to start than you thought?
            *   Which technique will you try next time or tomorrow?

### **Sub-Module 0.5: Intermediate Procrastination Techniques (Theory)**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management / Mindset
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **There's no such thing as procrastination:** When we give procrastination a name, it can prevent us from tackling the issue effectively. Procrastination can occur due to many different reasons. Each trigger and response can have different solutions. To end procrastination, we must be specific in what behaviour we are trying to change and what causes this behaviour.
    *   **The nature of motivation:** Motivation always fluctuates because many variables influence it (Mood, Sleep quality, Interest, Sense of purpose, etc.). Your plans must allow you to achieve your goals even on a bad day with low motivation.
    *   **Willpower-dependent vs willpower-enhanced:** It is unrealistic to assume all factors influencing motivation can be perfectly controlled. Instead, we must rely on habits and environments to move us into auto-pilot. By doing so, we can become willpower-enhanced, rather than willpower-dependent.

### **Sub-Module 0.6: Intermediate Procrastination Techniques 2 (Framework)**

*   **Note to Agent:** This introduces the BEDS-M framework, a highly effective set of tools for improving focus.
*   **Technique: BEDS-M Framework**
    *   **(B) Burnt ships strategy**
        *   **What is it?** The strategy is to burn your transport ships after using them so you have no path of retreat. This translates to setting high consequences of failure for tasks.
        *   **How do we use it?** Some learners form accountability pairs where the consequence of failure is to stand up and shout in the middle of a crowded hall.
        *   **How useful is it?** This is a useful adjunct when other methods alone are not enough. It is more suited for short-term change and less effective long-term. Use when other methods seem insufficient or when there are certain behaviours that are a high, urgent priority to change.
    *   **(E) Environment**
        *   **What is it?** Controlling your environment means removing the cookie jar, and therefore the need to use motivation and willpower in the first place.
        *   **How do we use it?** You must make your environment conducive to success, which requires you to remove anything that may cause procrastination. Removing distractions is much easier and more productive than resisting distractions using your willpower.
        *   **How useful is it?** This strategy is potentially the most powerful of all. In many cases, this strategy alone is enough to change behaviours permanently.
    *   **(D) Distraction cheat sheet**
        *   **What is it?** A simple sheet of paper where you can track distractors. Over time, this allows you to make adjustments to your environment to remove them.
        *   **How do we use it?** Have a piece of paper next to you while you are studying. Whenever you become distracted, write that distraction onto your distraction cheat sheet. Then, when you are setting up the environment, you refer to this cheat sheet to eliminate any new distractions.
    *   **(S) Scheduling**
        *   **What is it?** It's a schedule.
        *   **How useful is it?** When used correctly and sustainably, schedules improve our ability to focus at a psychological level. This is likely due to: Improved clarity over tasks and events, Reduced cognitive burden of decision-making, Reduced flow disruption, Reduced context switching.
    *   **(M) Minimum viable goals (MVG)**
        *   **What is it?** These are the easiest and most achievable goals needed to accomplish larger goals. MVGs must be the smallest possible action step where the motivation required is as close to zero as possible.
        *   **How do we use it?** 1. Start with a larger desired behaviour. 2. Identify the steps needed to begin. 3. Break down the steps until you get to a point where it feels so easy that being unable to achieve it feels ridiculous.
*   **Task: Optimise your environment and refine it with a Distraction sheet**
    1.  Write down a list of things that distract you. They could be physical things, digital distractions, or even people.
    2.  Write down a list of changes you could make to your environment to remove the distractions or deter/inform people to help you focus.
    3.  Make the changes to your environment as best you can.
    4.  Next time you have a focused session, note any distractions on your distractions sheet.
    5.  Adjust your environment again based on your distractions sheet.
    *   **Goal:** Repeat this process for at least **three sessions.** By this point, you should have made some high-yield changes to take control of your focus.

### **Sub-Module 0.7: Increasing Your Success Rate**

*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
*   **Key Concept:** Our brain is notoriously bad at understanding how skilled we are at things. Research on the **illusion of competence** has shown that we tend to overestimate our ability. Later, we'll teach you a precise way to track and evaluate your true competence with any skill. For now, we can use this simple table to estimate your skill level.
*   **Technique: The Rapid Start Check (3-Level Skill Evaluation Table)**

| Level | Description | Level of practice | Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidently unknown** | We may have high confidence because we confuse "understanding" the theory with actual competence. | Very little practice using the skill in different contexts (if any). | Practice is needed for accurate data on real skill levels. **Do not proceed until further practice.** |
| **Developing skill** | We may have low accuracy or consistency with using skills in different situations. | Some practice has revealed weaknesses and gaps. | Additional practice is recommended to consolidate skills. Learning more new skills is likely to cause overload. |
| **Stabilising skill** | Our skills are becoming comfortable and consistent. It requires relatively little effort to use it accurately. | There has been significant practice under different challenges and situations. | **You are ready to learn new skills!** |

### **Sub-Module 0.8: Tasks - Rapid Start (Module-Wide Tasks)**

*   **Task 1: Growth Habit Mapping**
    *   **Skill:** Mindset
    *   **Instructions:** This quick activity helps us build awareness of growth-response habits that may hinder us from progressing. **In 10 minutes, write down in bullet points:**
        1.  How you tend to respond to challenges and the fear of failure.
        2.  How you tend to respond to learning methods that feel difficult or different.
        3.  Are you normally aware of how you respond?
    *   **After completing this activity:**
        *   If you have found growth-resistant habits, but you are **not** normally aware of them at the time, try to catch yourself next time. Your crucial next step is to gain awareness of these habits when they affect you.
        *   If you have found growth-resistant habits and you **are** aware of them at the time, try to use Minimum Viable Goals (MVGs) to expose yourself to challenges gradually. Your crucial next step is gaining exposure to gradually retrain these habits.
        *   If you found multiple growth-resistant habits, we recommend repeating this activity every 2 to 3 months.
*   **Task 2: Schedule Practice Blocks**
    *   **Skill:** Self-Management / Self-Regulation
    *   **Instructions:** Finding your biggest mistakes as early as possible is the key to rapid skill development. Practice blocks are a dedicated time for finding as many mistakes as possible, as quickly as possible.
        1.  Schedule at least 30 minutes (up to 3 hours) every 3 to 5 days at a time that you can consistently adhere to. This is your **practice block.**
        2.  During your practice block, apply a new technique on which you are gaining skill competence. It could be an enabler skill (like focus management), a learning skill or both in the same session!
        3.  Focus on applying each step of the technique as accurately as possible.
        4.  Note down on a separate document or paper whenever you face difficulties or deviate from the technique.
        5.  If you are unsure about whether you have used a technique correctly, ask for feedback on our safe and supportive community.
    *   **Goal:** By the end of your practice block, your goal is to identify as many mistakes, habits, or unproductive tendencies as possible.

### **Sub-Module 0.9: BASELINE & Check - RS (Final Module Checkpoint)**

*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
*   **Action: BASELINE Establishment.** The Agent will now prompt the user to consolidate their starting point by reviewing their diagnostic report (e.g., Unchained archetype) and the results of their "Growth Habit Mapping" task. This establishes a clear self-awareness baseline.
*   **Action: Check - RS.** This is the final gate for Module 0. The Agent will guide the user to evaluate themselves against the "Rapid Start skills list" using the 3-level evaluation table from Sub-Module 0.7.
*   **Skills List for Evaluation:**
    1.  Evaluating tasks based on importance vs urgency.
    2.  Scheduling important, non-urgent tasks to prevent urgency trapping.
    3.  Using a calendar to create manageable and achievable schedules.
    4.  Managing focus and procrastination to a high level of consistency.
*   **Gate:** The user must be at or near "Stabilising skill" for these items before proceeding to Module 1.
