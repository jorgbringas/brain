### **Sub-Module 1.1: The Problem with Studying**

*   **Skill:** Mindset / Self-Regulation
*   **Key Points:**
    1.  Study systems built around spaced retrieval (i.e. repetition) are no longer unique or sufficient.
    2.  Using techniques that change the slope of the forgetting curve is more effective than doing more repetition.
    3.  We tend to believe harmful myths about studying and learning due to a lack of accurate mainstream information.
    4.  We are more confident about things we know very little about, which can cause us to reject the advice we need most.
*   **Technique: Recognising when we are on Mt. Stupid**
    *   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
    *   **Core Concept:** Internationally best-selling author Adam Grant recommends asking yourself: **“What conditions are necessary for my belief to be true?”** By asking yourself this, you can objectively examine the likelihood that your belief is true.
    *   **Example:** If you believe your method of studying is the best, the conditions for it to be true are that:
        *   You know all of the alternatives,
        *   You know these alternatives deeply enough to assess their effectiveness accurately,
        *   You are aware of what “the best” means,
        *   You have started using “the best” method potentially without any training, and
        *   “The best” method must be very common (if your approach is similar to how others study).
*   **Technique: A faster way to assess your confidence**
    *   **Core Concept:** Another approach is to assess your confidence. Consider the graph below of the Dunning-Kruger effect curve. Since there are only two points in the graph where a person’s confidence is high, you can ask yourself:
        1.  Do you have a high level of confidence?
        2.  Have you spent enough time learning about this to be considered a professional?
    *   **Conclusion:** If your first answer is **yes** but your second answer is **no**, you are probably near Mt. Stupid!
*   **Key Principle: Self-awareness is the key.** We’re all on Mt. Stupid for something. If we can recognise that our sense of confidence may not match our actual expertise, we can be more open-minded and accept advice. This is a hallmark of a successful learner.

### **Sub-Module 1.2: Marginal Gains**

*   **Skill:** Mindset / Self-Regulation
*   **Key Points:**
    1.  Consistency is better than sudden bursts of effort.
    2.  Marginal gains are not only easier and more sustainable, they also produce a greater total effect.
    3.  Marginal gains stack and compound, which is why starting imperfectly now is better than starting perfectly later and missing out on compound gains.
*   **Core Concept: Tracking Marginal Gains**
    *   **Why we must track:** The human brain is terrible at tracking small changes that occur gradually. Therefore, most people will have absolutely no intuitive sense of whether they are making marginal gains during the early stages. Tracking it actively is one of the only ways to visualise and "feel" the progress.
    *   **The Positive Motivation Cycle:** Viewing progress through marginal gains creates a positive motivation cycle. (Intention -> Action -> Visible Outcome -> Positive Reinforcement).
    *   **The Demotivation Spiral:** Without marginal gains, the outcomes become invisible, and we enter a demotivation spiral. Over time, this can lead to burn out as our efforts seem to be in vain.
*   **Task: Identify your marginal gains for learning efficiently**
    *   **Instruction:** Follow the five steps outlined in our "Tracking marginal gains" guide to identify your 1% gains for learning efficiency. Complete this task once you have compounded your 1% gains at least three times. This means you have:
        1.  Identified a marginal gain.
        2.  Tried to reach it.
        3.  Reflected on the experience.
        4.  Identified the next marginal gain with our 5-step framework.
        5.  Repeated this process twice.
    *   **Tip:** Check out what other learners think of as marginal gains in the #wins-and-gains channel on our community (simulate a community). This is an excellent source of ideas. We encourage you to post your marginal gains on this channel, too!

### **Sub-Module 1.3: Spacing, Interleaving, and Retrieval (SIR)**

*   **Skill:** Retrieval / Deep Processing
*   **Introduction:** Spaced, interleaved retrieval is one of the core foundational techniques of any learning system. Even as we teach you more learning techniques later in the program, SIR will remain.
*   **Important Notes about training SIR:**
    *   SIR is not one technique - it is a method. The difficulty of using SIR depends on the difficulty of the interleaved retrieval techniques you use.
    *   Retrieval techniques are generally easier to master than encoding techniques. You can expect to master each technique with only 3 to 5 hours of experience.
    *   The consequence of not using SIR is very high.
*   **Core Concept: Encoding vs Retrieval**
    *   Systems that rely on spaced retrieval lead to repetition and time wasting. Spaced retrieval alone is insufficient to give you a competitive advantage or to produce your desired results reliably. **However, retrieval practice is still necessary for a complete study system.**
    *   **Two sides of the learning coin:** You cannot be efficient and accurate without both encoding and retrieval. Outside of inadequate encoding, "retrieval failure" is a common cause of knowledge decay of previously encoded information. When information is encoded to a higher quality, we need less retrieval.
    *   **Notice:** As the encoding skill increases, retrieval requirements never become zero. We always need some level of retrieval because our brain is never leak-proof (i.e. there is always some knowledge decay).

#### **1.3.1) Spacing Tips**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management
*   **Principle:** How often should I space my retrieval sessions? The purpose of spacing is to practice your retrieval and reinforce information in your memory. In general, you should wait until you are **just starting to forget** the material.
    *   If your spacing is **too frequent**, this will create unnecessary repetition and work as you're testing yourself too early in the forgetting curve.
    *   If your spacing is **too infrequent**, this will cause you to waste time during each revision as you've forgotten too much.
*   **Technique: Spacing Interval Guidelines (Expanding-Gap)**
    *   After learning something for the first time, review it later on the same day.
    *   Next review 2 or 3 days later.
    *   Next review 5 to 10 days later.
    *   Next review 10 to 20 days later.
    *   Next review 1 to 2 months later.
*   **Technique: Our Recommended Retrieval Schedule (Practical Application)**
    *   In practice, we can use this simple schedule:
        1.  Revise on the same day you learned it.
        2.  Do a mid-week revision of everything from the previous 2 days. (You can skip this if there isn’t much to revise. For high school students, this mid-week revision is often unnecessary as the volume of information is substantially lower than at university.)
        3.  Do an end-of-week revision for the entire week’s content.
        4.  Do an end-of-month revision for the entire month’s content.
        5.  Revise the entire test or exam’s content in the 1 or 2 weeks before the assessment.
    *   For beginners, we recommend starting with no less than 30 minutes per subject for end-of-week and no less than 1.5 hours per subject for end-of-month.

#### **1.3.2) Interleaving Tips**

*   **Skill:** Retrieval / Deep Processing
*   **Principle:** To use interleaving, review information from **multiple angles and perspectives.** Research strongly shows that using more interleaving produces better results. It also protects you from **curveball** exam questions because you are used to seeing the information in multiple ways.
*   **Technique: Understanding Different Interleaving Techniques**
    *   **Skill:** Retrieval / Self-Regulation
    *   All of these techniques can work for all subjects, including maths, sciences and English. There are a near-endless number of ways to challenge your knowledge. The below is just a small list of examples:
        *   Teach an imaginary student
        *   Draw a mindmap
        *   Draw an image instead of using words to find a visual way of expressing information
        *   Answer practice questions
        *   Create your own challenging test questions
        *   Create a test question that puts what you’ve learned into a real-world context
        *   Take a difficult question you found in a practice test and modify it so that it involves different variables or adds an extra step
        *   Form a study group and quiz each other – for some subjects you can even debate the topic, with one side trying to prove that the other person is missing a point or understanding it incorrectly

#### **1.3.3) Retrieval Tips**

*   **Skill:** Retrieval
*   **Principle:** **Retrieval** means taking information from your long-term memory and bringing it into your working memory to recall, solve problems and answer questions. No learning system is complete without adequate retrieval practice.
*   **Technique: RETRIEVAL DURING DEDICATED REVISION SESSIONS**
    *   **Tip 1: Don’t look at your notes beforehand.** It’s better to give it a go from memory first, then check your notes after to see what you’ve missed. Checking notes beforehand can simply cue the information back into your working memory without actively needing to retrieve it. This is unrealistic practice for exam situations.
    *   **Tip 2: Always generate an answer, even if you are unsure.** Getting the wrong answer helps you to remember the right answer when you do correct yourself.
    *   **Tip 3: Practice retrieving information fully as if you were being assessed.** For example, when teaching, teach out loud and articulate properly. When writing answers, write the best answer you can. When creating questions, write the most specific and high-quality question you can. In an exam situation, we need to have highly accurate and high standards of retrieval. Practising this standard of retrieval during our revision helps to identify subtle weaknesses.
*   **Technique: RETRIEVAL DURING INITIAL STUDY OR CLASS (Micro-Retrieval)**
    *   **Tip 1:** In each study session, look for opportunities to do some “micro-retrieval”. For example, before writing notes, always give yourself time to think and process what has been said. It’s always better to write about an entire paragraph or a group of ideas after you’ve thought about it, rather than write it down first and then think about it.
    *   **Tip 2:** As a rule of thumb, you should never write mindlessly, or write before having understood what you are writing.
    *   **Tip 3:** When you do write, always try to write it from memory first, before referring back to your notes (even if all you are writing is one or two lines, or a single doodle).

### **Sub-Module 1.4: Recommended Tasks for Fundamentals 1**

*   **Task 1: Plan Your Retrieval Strategy**
    *   **Instructions:** Write down a plan of what changes you will make to your revision or note-taking in class or while studying to maximise retrieval. Relate this to your spaced and interleaved schedule to walk away with a plan of how you will tackle the next week or two of studying.
    *   **Example Plan:**
        *   "I will use 3 types of interleaving this week."
        *   "While studying, I will only write notes after I encoded the information."
        *   "I will incorporate Retrieval while learning."
*   **Task 2: Select Your Interleaving Techniques**
    *   **Instructions:** Pick at least 3 of the interleaving techniques (from the interleaving.md file or from the list of examples listed above on interleaving tips) and do them (in any order) at each of your spaced revision sessions. Make a note of these techniques so that you can come back to it for ideas in the future.
*   **Task 3: Create a one-month SIR schedule**
    *   **Instructions:** Using the techniques and guidelines from the SIR lesson, schedule your retrieval sessions for the next month. **Complete at least the first week before marking this task as complete.** You do not need to complete the entire month before moving on.

### **Sub-Module 1.5: Quiz - SIR Checkpoint**

*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
*   **Agent's Role:** The Agent will administer this quiz to check the user's conceptual understanding of how to apply Spacing, Interleaving, and Retrieval (SIR) principles. After each question, the agent will provide the "Learning notes" as feedback to explain the correct answer and the underlying principles.

#### **Question 1**

**Scenario:** Michael is a first-year computer science and engineering student without experience developing and building web applications. In the first semester, his university teaches a programming language called Javascript. In the second semester, he is taught another language called PHP. Javascript and PHP are often used together to produce web apps. When used correctly, they can produce web apps that have much more diverse and complex functionality than either one alone.

**Question 1.1:** What kind of approach to learning would be most beneficial for Michael to learn programming?

*   **a)** He should develop a big-picture theoretical understanding of the programming languages and move to primarily procedural-focused interleaving methods.
*   **b)** He should use declarative-focused interleaving methods with some procedural methods intermittently.
*   **c)** He should begin with procedural-focused methods and ignore the declarative and theoretical aspects.
*   **d)** He should begin with a challenging project that is far beyond his current skill level and learn while attempting to complete it.

**Correct Answer:** a

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
For procedurally heavy disciplines like programming, the theoretical component is usually smaller than in declarative heavy subjects (like many sciences). However, the theoretical component is still important for enhancing our ability to apply knowledge appropriately and guide our procedural practice. After developing a rapid theoretical understanding of the programming languages' logic, purpose, functions, and relationships, Michael should move to procedurally dominant methods of interleaved retrieval.

Both procedural and declarative knowledge are necessary to develop a skill proficiently. Ignoring the theory creates a bottleneck of declarative knowledge, increasing the risk of being a technically capable programmer who is unable to design logical, efficient, and strategically aligned software solutions. Ignoring the procedural aspects creates a bottleneck in procedural knowledge, increasing the risk of being adept at high-level design but unable to code efficiently.

Regarding excessive challenge (option d): Learning through very high challenges can also be effective, but there is no benefit to starting at this level, instead of progressing from more basic levels of execution and working towards higher levels of challenges swiftly. Over-challenging himself can result in slower skill acquisition due to reproductively high error rates.

**Question 1.2:** Michael is deciding on the best way to focus his time. Choose the correct statement.

*   **a)** He should focus on mastering one language first before moving onto the next one.
*   **b)** He should focus on learning both languages at the same time.
*   **c)** He should focus on learning the theory for one language while practising the application of the other.
*   **d)** He should aim to gain reasonable competence with each set of functions individually, then combine them with previously learned functions as he goes.

**Correct Answer:** b

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
When learning any topic or skill, it is generally useful to learn wider before learning deeper. This is because building knowledge and skills is similar to constructing a building. Building a narrow and tall tower is much more unstable and difficult compared to a pyramid. Similarly, depth is easier to attain when there is a strong foundation of wider, more basic principles to build on. The learnings from one domain can often assist in learning another domain.

In this scenario, Michael would benefit from learning both languages simultaneously, as we know both are related and often used together. Likewise, when learning the theory and applying the knowledge, both should be done together or alternated between frequently to maximise learning. As his expertise grows, he should constantly consolidate what he has learned so that his network of knowledge strengthens.

#### **Question 2**

**Scenario:** Gabriella is a biology major who has recently started improving her learning skills through a state-of-the-art learning skills program. She is fascinated by improving her learning efficiency through improving her encoding. She has previously had bad experiences with becoming overwhelmed by flashcards. Although they were effective, they were too time-consuming. She also noticed that they were not as effective recently as a few years ago when she was still in high school.

**Question 2.1:** Gabriella spends one month gradually improving her encoding skills. She is extremely focused and diligent on improving her encoding. However, she finds that her overall performance is not as good as she had hoped. Specifically, she makes more mistakes during exams and feels overconfident. Which of the following is the most likely reason for this?

*   **a)** She has learned the encoding techniques incorrectly.
*   **b)** She does not have enough retrieval practice.
*   **c)** She is a perfectionist and feels it is never good enough.
*   **d)** This is a normal part of improving learning skills in the short-term. Over time, her results should improve again.

**Correct Answer:** b

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
Gabriella's increased error rate and overconfidence are signs of a lack of retrieval practice.

**Common Issue:** When learning new encoding skills intensively, it's common for people to forget about how important retrieval is in a learning system, especially in the early stages when encoding is still developing. When improving learning skills, techniques and methods should be incorporated and replaced gradually. This is to avoid sudden changes in your learning system that can cause more harm than good. It is also unlikely that these undesirable results have arisen from learning incorrect encoding techniques. This is usually because most people start with unrefined encoding methods, so most attempts to improve it tend to be positive overall.

#### **Question 3**

**Scenario:** Steve is a 3rd-year medical student about to sit a history-taking OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). He will be assessed on his ability to interview patients by asking questions about their condition in a logical manner to determine a diagnosis and propose a suitable treatment. Steve has been told ahead of time that the patient would have one of four possible respiratory conditions he has learned about. He is fairly confident in his knowledge about each individual condition, but is unsure about whether he can use this knowledge to conduct a patient interview and create a personalised treatment plan.

**Question:** Which of the following is the best way for Steve to prepare?

*   **a)** Repeating a list of questions he has to ask during the patient interview from memory, for each condition. He should do this until all questions have been memorised.
*   **b)** Using the “simple relational teaching” method for each condition to develop robust theoretical knowledge.
*   **c)** Using the “challenge case (integrative)” method using cases involving multiple conditions to practise interview technique and his ability to propose a suitable treatment.
*   **d)** Using the “challenge case (simple)” method for each individual condition to practise interview technique and his ability to propose a suitable treatment.

**Correct Answer:** c

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
Steve must focus on a method of interleaving that challenges both his declarative knowledge and his procedural knowledge in conducting interviews. This is especially true as Steve already has confidence in his baseline theoretical knowledge for each condition. Therefore, lower-order memorisation such as repeating questions, or mid-order declarative-focused methods such as simple relational teaching are unlikely to be sufficient. While Steve could use the challenge case (simple) method, he already feels confident in his knowledge for each condition. Therefore, Steve should challenge himself at a higher level using the integrative challenge method.

#### **Question 4**

**Scenario:** Glu has ambitions to become the world’s greatest super villain. However, to do so, he needs to ace his university physics exam that is coming in 3 weeks. He understands that physics is both a declarative and procedural subject. He feels confident with the basics, but he is equally unconfident with both declarative and procedural components for solving more complex problems (like shrinking the moon). He is a busy super villain but Glu is willing to put in the work.

**Question:** Assuming that his only problem is that he needs to do spaced, interleaved revision, which of the following would be the ideal combination of techniques?

*   **a)** He should use simple relational teaching, brain dump (mindmap), use flashcards, solve textbook-provided practice questions, and redesign his mind map to look simpler. He should revise daily using a combination of these techniques.
*   **b)** He should make his minions dress up as him and do the exam.
*   **c)** He should complete practice questions (direct method), repeat chunkmaps, and use flashcards. He should revise every three days using a combination of these techniques.
*   **d)** He should develop his own challenge questions, do simple relational reteaching, and add additional variables to textbook-provided questions. He should revise every three days using a combination of these techniques.

**Correct Answer:** d

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
Glu struggles with more complex applications of knowledge. This indicates he needs to work on his higher-order retrieval. Only two options cover higher-order needs sufficiently. However, one option requires Glu to revise daily, while the other has a longer spacing interval of three days. The longer spacing interval is likely to be more appropriate as it is more manageable on a busy schedule, as well as more beneficial for finding long-term memory gaps.

#### **Question 5**

**Scenario:** Jean is trying to learn Mandarin for the first time. She tries using flashcards to memorise all the vocabulary and is able to answer her flashcards correctly most of the time. She understands how sentences must be structured and she is told that her pronunciation of words is good! Unfortunately, she still finds that she is unable to speak Mandarin coherently in real-life conversations.

**Question:** What is the next best step that Jean can take to improve her speaking ability?

*   **a)** Think of a common scenario where she would need to speak Mandarin and practise several variations of conversations that could arise in this setting until she feels confident to navigate a real-life dialogue in this scenario.
*   **b)** Chain dialogues and phrases together to create a simple, varied conversation starting with phrases she has already learned.
*   **c)** Memorise a simple scripted conversation between a consumer and shopkeeper in her textbook by active recall.
*   **d)** Create flashcards for grammar and sentence structures to supplement her flashcards for vocabulary.

**Correct Answer:** b

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
Chaining dialogue is an example of retrieved execution (applied). It seems that Jean’s current level of mastery is relatively low, since she is able to recall isolated vocabulary under cued recall, but is unable to engage in uncued recall and apply her knowledge efficiently. As the bottleneck is in application of knowledge, declarative-focused methods are not likely to be very beneficial. Jean must focus on some form of retrieved execution to build better procedural and conditional knowledge.

Chaining dialogues to create simple and varied conversations using phrases she has already learned is a good next step for Jean’s skill level. Taking this a step further into integrative or applied retrieved execution (such as attempting to gain fluency in real-life scenarios with multiple variations of conversations) is likely to be too difficult for her at this time.

#### **Question 6**

**Scenario:** Sam graduated from university six years ago but enjoys learning from productivity and business books. She has hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur and loves self-learning. Sam reads and listens to several books per year. She finds the concepts fascinating and she feels that she understands them easily.

**Question:** How can Sam learn from these books to effectively prepare her for applying her knowledge in real life?

*   **a)** Continue to read many more books to improve her theoretical knowledge. Once she has enough theoretical knowledge to avoid making mistakes, apply the knowledge by starting a business.
*   **b)** Create relational flashcards that summarise the main relationships between the core ideas of the books they have read and go through their flashcards each week.
*   **c)** Write non-linear, relational notes for each book they have read to express the key relationships between concepts and how they influence each other.
*   **d)** Start a simple, low-cost business where she can apply the principles she learns immediately. She can grow this business slowly or quickly, depending on what kind of principles she wants to apply.

**Correct Answer:** d

**Learning Notes (Feedback for User):**
Sam must apply her knowledge to find gaps in both declarative and procedural knowledge. This should be done in a fail-fast-fail-safe approach. Starting a low-cost business that does not need to grow aggressively allows her to apply her knowledge immediately, without much risk of failure. Delaying the application of theory until she can “avoid making mistakes” is unrealistic and unhelpful as the gaps in her knowledge will remain untested.

In this scenario, declarative-focused methods will have limited benefits as the concepts are not difficult to understand. In addition, her bottleneck to applying knowledge in real life is in her low procedural and conditional knowledge, rather than declarative knowledge.
