# Interleaving Table Full

## Mastering interleaving

This guide is a comprehensive resource for implementing interleaving in your learning system. At the top, you will find examples of interleaving techniques for you to use and adapt. At the bottom, there are more notes on general guidelines and frequently asked questions.

### Useless techniques

These techniques offer so little benefit that they should not be used in any circumstances. There are always better alternatives for the same amount of time.

**Useless Techniques:**

*   **Declarative-focused:**
    *   Passive re-reading and re-writing
    *   Passive re-listening
    *   Practice questions (passive method)
    *   Peer/group discussion (undirected)
*   **Procedural-focused:**
    *   Re-reading and re-rewriting notes
    *   REBIM

### Explanations of Useless Techniques

#### Passive re-reading, re-writing, and re-listening

Simply listening, reading, and re-writing notes without any particular cognitive focus. Usually boring, monotonous, disengaged, and repetitive. The focus may be on trying to memorise what is being written, repeatedly saying the sentences mentally, or just "trying to understand". This does not activate most effective learning pathways and is highly time-consuming and demotivating.

#### REBIM (Repetitive Execution Beyond Initial Mastery)

A technique coined by Dr Justin Sung, REBIM refers to the repetitive completion of tasks or activities for skills and processes that can already be done to a high level of proficiency. For example, coding the same simple scripts repeatedly, solving the same difficulty of maths questions despite already being able to answer them easily, or engaging in the same kind of dialogue or conversation for languages when already fluent. The benefit of the technique is negligible considering the alternative techniques that could be used instead.

#### Practice questions (passive method)

Solving problems or answering questions and immediately checking the answer. Often paired with answering the question mentally only or concluding, "I could solve that," without going through all the steps and checking the answers to see if it makes sense. Because the question seems familiar and the answer makes sense, learners can believe that they can solve it in a realistic retrieval setting. However, the human brain tends to overestimate our abilities and underestimate challenges. As a result, this method consistently fails to identify knowledge gaps while wasting valuable practice questions. This is a common way of using practice questions with several alternative methods that are much more effective.

#### Peer/group discussion (undirected)

Group discussion can be useful. However, most group study wastes time compared to what could be achieved in the same amount of time through alternative techniques. Undirected group discussion has so many more effective alternatives that it has no place in a learning system.

## Declarative-focused techniques

**Note:** Some of the techniques are suitable for multiple orders of learning. These techniques are marked with an asterisk (*).

### About declarative knowledge types

Declarative knowledge is information that is based on facts, concepts and logic. It is the type of knowledge that involves encoding content material. Declarative knowledge is sometimes also called conceptual knowledge or descriptive.

### Characteristics of declarative knowledge

One of the characteristics of declarative knowledge is that the information itself remains static. For example, if you learn about how a kidney functions, the nature of this information does not change, since the facts are already set. Your understanding and nuanced appreciation of the information may change, the facts remain static.

This is unlike procedural knowledge whereby the knowledge on how to execute on certain processes innately changes as mastery grows.

### Examples of predominantly declarative knowledge:

*   Science subjects
*   History
*   Politics
*   Law
*   Economics theory
*   Accounting theory
*   Mathematics theory
*   Business and finance theory
*   Coding logic
*   Language vocabulary, syntax, grammar and structure

### Declarative-focused Techniques:

*   **Knowledge mastery (order of learning): Lower-order**
    *   (Best for direct fact recall and detail memorisation)
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   3Cs
        *   Flashcards (simple)
        *   Brain dump (linear)

        *   Teaching (isolated)
        *   Feynman method*
        *   Method of loci or our Modified Method of Loci
        *   Story/link method
        *   Ben system
*   **Knowledge mastery (order of learning): Mid-order**
    *   (Best for knowledge application, basic problem solving, and obvious relationships)
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Flashcards (simple relational)
        *   Brain dump (mindmap)*
        *   Generated questions (simple relational or multi-relational)
        *   Teaching (simple relational)
        *   Practice questions (direct method and advanced group method*)
        *   Feynman method*
*   **Knowledge mastery (order of learning): Higher-order**
    *   (Best for discussions and complex problem-solving where multiple concepts affect each other)
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Chunkmaps
        *   Flashcards (evaluative)
        *   Brain dump (mindmap)*
        *   Generated questions (evaluative)
        *   Teaching (Modified WPW)
        *   Peer/Group discussion (evaluative)
        *   Practice questions (extended method and advanced group method*)
        *   Feynman method*

## Explanations of Declarative Techniques

### 3Cs (Cover, copy, check)

A low-level "fill-in-the-blanks" style retrieval technique whereby you cover part of your notes, then attempt to rewrite or redraw the covered part from memory. You then uncover the notes and check. This has been shown to be effective at improving short-term retention of basic information, especially among younger children. Flashcards that use image-occlusion methods are a more practical and efficient variation of this. Most effective for labelling diagrams and processes.

### Flashcards (all variations)

*   **Simple:** Flashcards, either physical or through a digital medium such as Anki (preferred). The characteristic feature of simple flashcards is that each card tests isolated facts, concepts or processes (see generated questions - isolated). Concepts do not relate to each other. Often useful for specific definitions, constants or other highly specific pieces of information that do not fit into relational notes. When higher-order encoding is inadequate, simple flashcards are often overloaded. This causes substantial wasted time through repetition and steep forgetting curves.
*   **Simple relational:** Each card tests the relationships and influences that two or three concepts have on each other. Useful for key relationships that are highly specific and difficult to remember. These are often processes that are conceptually separate from the rest of the topic and are, therefore, hard to represent through relational note-taking. These relationships may not easily fit into chunks.
*   **Evaluative:** Each card holds a generated question (evaluative). See generated questions below for more details on this method.

### Generated questions (all variations)

*   **Isolated:** Create your own practice questions. Isolated questions focus on retrieving single facts, concepts and explanations of isolated processes. Many "what" based questions tend to be isolated. The types of questions at this level are ideally served via simple flashcards.
*   **Simple relational and multi-relational:** Simple relational questions challenge you to explain or discuss the relationship between **two** related ideas. Multi-relational questions challenge you to retrieve the relationships between **more than two** related ideas. These can be combined as part of *Practice questions - advanced group method*.
*   **Evaluative:** Evaluative questions challenge you to discuss relationships between multiple related ideas and conclude on the relationships' strength and importance. A crucial part of evaluative questions is that the learner must make a value judgment on the importance of concepts compared to other concepts. This level of questioning has significantly beneficial learning effects for depth of knowledge and retention.
    *   Because evaluative questions are time-consuming to create, it is recommended to create questions in one session and answer them in another. Creating questions produces retrieval benefits, as does answering them. By splitting the question creation and answering process, we are able to receive two rounds of positive learning effects. One retrieval session also prepares us for the next.
    *   These can be combined as part of *Practice questions - advanced group method*.

### Brain dumps (all variations)

*   **Linear:** This is an easy technique for testing mass retrieval at low to mid levels of knowledge mastery. Type out everything you know about a particular topic. Follow learning objectives as a guide if they are available. Due to the limitations of linear notes on representing relationships, it is inefficient for higher-order testing. It is also inefficient at finding gaps as it relies on "dumping" all our knowledge until we stumble upon retrieval difficulties. Linear brain dumps are helpful as an end-stage retrieval technique used just before assessments. Depending on available time, brain dumps can be on individual concepts or entire topics.
*   **Mindmap:** This variation is the same as a linear brain dump but in a mindmap form. Mindmap brain dumps are superior for higher-order knowledge testing and inferior for lower-order detail testing. As more difficult assessment and retrieval standards force you to think in relationships and chunks, this form of brain dumping is strategically more high-yield for most. Mindmap brain dumps are recommended in the early stages of retrieval practice to find big-picture gaps quickly, before transitioning to lower-order methods.

### Teaching (all variations)

*   **Isolated:** Teach a topic to a friend or imaginary student. Teaching to an imaginary student is preferred because when teaching to a friend, they may fill in gaps for you with their own knowledge instead of forcing you to confront gaps or inadequate explanations. In the isolated variation, teaching is limited to directly explaining facts, concepts and processes. Isolated teaching is a relatively time-consuming retrieval method that is lower-order centred. As a result, other alternatives, such as flashcards, tend to be preferred.
*   **Simple relational:** We now explain and discuss how different concepts and processes relate to each other. Simple relational teaching is a relatively effective form of retrieval and can be incorporated in the early to mid stages of revision scheduling as it can find gaps in knowledge quickly.
    *   **Pro tip:** Isolated and simple relational teaching is most useful when applied during learning sessions whereby you teach something you have just processed immediately after learning it. We sometimes call this "micro-retrieval". Forcing yourself to teach what you learn straight away activates beneficial generative effects of learning and can help improve deep processing.
*   **Modified Whole-Part-Whole (WPW):** Taught in the late stages of the program, the modified WPW is potentially the most difficult learning technique in the program. It requires an expert level of knowledge mastery to execute correctly. It challenges all orders of knowledge mastery with rapid knowledge gap identification. Unfortunately, the benefit of this method is directly related to the learner's skill level at using the technique and their encoding proficiency. Modified WPW can be considered impossible unless the fundamental encoding techniques have reached total mastery, with at least near mastery of the Ascent-stage encoding methods.

## Practice questions (all variations excluding passive)

*   **Direct:** This is a conventional way of using practice questions. It involves solving problems and answering questions from memory. Answers are checked immediately after. Learning material is reviewed for deeper understanding if answers are incorrect. This method activates beneficial generative learning effects by answering the questions and helps us focus on knowledge gaps.
    *   However, the direct method increases the risk of missing gaps or classifying incorrect answers as "silly mistakes". This is because the root cause of the mistake can remain hidden. This method is not recommended for most situations compared to alternatives, as practice questions are a limited and valuable resource.
*   **Extended:** After answering practice questions to your best attempt, mark the questions you felt unsure about. Then, review your learning material and create your own "perfect" answer sheet. If an official answer sheet is available, you can check your answer sheet against an official answer sheet. Any question you were unsure about indicates a knowledge gap for you to pay special attention to, regardless of whether it was "officially" correct or not. This is because getting an answer correct for one question does not guarantee you will get it correct in variations of the same knowledge. A lack of confidence in answering is a sufficient indication of a gap.
    *   In the extended method, we test our knowledge by:
        1.  Answering the questions
        2.  Evaluating our confidence
        3.  Creating perfect answers
        4.  Checking our answers against official answers to find even more gaps
    *   As the extended method of practice questions is time-consuming, we recommend dedicating a large block of time or splitting the method across multiple retrieval sessions. Examples are given below.
*   **Peer/group discussion (evaluative):** Unlike in undirected group discussion, this method sets an explicit goal to critique, judge and argue the importance of different relationships and concepts, especially in view of the bigger picture. Methods of facilitating group study to achieve this are taught in the program.
*   **Chunkmaps (or GRINDEmaps):** These are mindmap variations taught as a core part of the encoding process in our Bear Hunter System taught in the Growth phase. Although the foundational skills are trained since Fundamentals 2, this method is not relevant until Ascent 3.
    *   It is listed as a retrieval method because if you have previous content that you studied before learning to create chunkmaps, it is worthwhile to re-encode it into chunkmaps to stimulate higher levels of mastery and improve retention.
    *   In this situation, this technique should be the first step of the revision process and performed as early as possible, making time for other forms of interleaved retrieval. Most people struggle to create a chunkmap with previously poorly encoded information, largely because it was initially never processed at higher levels.
*   **Method of loci, link/story method, and Ben system:** These are all different memorisation techniques. Some of these are taught in the course. However, many are not. The ones that are taught in the course are taught in late stages.
    *   Although these memorisation techniques are powerful for rote learning of isolated information, the use cases are very narrow. Learning these techniques early also tends to create over-reliance on these methods instead of developing proper encoding techniques, which are several-fold more efficient for most real-world learning needs. They are exclusively lower-order methods and are typically over-sold by "memory champions".
    *   They are recommended in specific use cases with large volumes of specific (sometimes ordered) information to learn in a single discrete list. Even then, there are usually more effective ways to encode this.
*   **Feynman method/technique:** The Feynman method is not a single technique but a guided structure for learning. The classical instructions are:
    1.  **Choose a Topic:** Select the topic or concept you want to learn or understand.
    2.  **Teach it to a Child:** Explain the topic as if you were teaching it to a child or someone with no prior knowledge of the subject. Use simple language and avoid jargon.
    3.  **Identify Gaps and Simplify:** As you explain the topic, pay attention to areas where your explanation is unclear or where you struggle to simplify. This helps you identify gaps in your understanding.
    4.  **Review and Refine:** Go back to your primary sources and learning materials to fill in the gaps and improve your understanding. Simplify your explanation further if necessary.
    *   The Feynman method is an early learning method that is popular for good reason. It is one of the first comprehensive methods for learning that forces multi-order knowledge mastery.
    *   For most people, using the Feynman method would be a great addition to their learning system. However, as the principles that make this method effective have been researched much more since it was originally described, the methods we teach allow you to achieve the same effects but better and more consistently.
    *   However, even though our methods directly supersede it, the Feynman method can still be helpful as a "micro-retrieval" technique. To do this, try to teach everything you learn "to a child" immediately after learning it. Activating components of the Feynman technique during learning sessions can help keep us anchored to the big picture.
    *   Note that our encoding techniques also directly encourage the same effects.
*   **The advanced group method for practice questions:** This interleaving technique is a composite of generated questions, peer/group discussion, and practice questions. It is an involved and extensive retrieval technique but one of the most consistently effective and useful across all declarative-focused subjects.
    *   **Instructions:**
        1.  Choose a topic.
        2.  Create a study group with at least 1 other person of a similar knowledge level to you (or higher).
        3.  Each person creates a practice exam. Ensure to cover some mid-order questions as well as more challenging and nuanced higher-order questions. Strictly lower-order questions can be addressed through other retrieval methods.
        4.  Create a perfect answer sheet for your exam by first brain dumping to the best of your ability, then reviewing your learning materials to refine and perfect the answers.
        5.  Swap the practice exams with each other. Hold onto your answer sheet.
        6.  Answer the exams from memory to the best of your ability.
        7.  Mark answers where you were uncertain for further review.
        8.  Create a perfect answer sheet for this practice exam by reviewing your learning materials.
        9.  Swap answer sheets with each other.
        10. Compare your answers against your answer sheet and their answer sheet. Look for differences between your answer sheet and theirs.
        11. If there are any points you disagree with wish to explore in more depth, discuss with the other person to arrive at a conclusion.
    *   This method tests multiple orders at multiple perspectives and forces positive generative effects of learning during steps 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. For each hour of time spent, the amount of learning consolidation and gap-testing is one of the highest out of all retrieval methods.
    *   As this method is time-consuming, we recommend splitting this process over multiple days.
    *   **Recommendation:** Due to its high effectiveness and efficiency, the advanced group method for practice questions is a method we generally recommend all learners to try and utilise, if possible.

## Procedural-focused techniques

**Note:** Some of the techniques are suitable for multiple orders of learning. These techniques are marked with an asterisk (*).

### About procedural knowledge types

Procedural knowledge is stored in different parts of the brain than declarative knowledge and involves some different cognitive processes. Procedural knowledge is based on actions, behaviours and processes, rather than facts or concepts. It is the knowledge of how to perform skills or procedures. In most settings, both declarative and procedural knowledge are required, but different subjects and settings require different levels of each.

### Characteristics of procedural knowledge

Procedural knowledge is dynamic and action-oriented, involving the ability to perform tasks and actions effectively. It is skill-based, context-dependent, and often implicit, requiring practice and hands-on experience for mastery. Unlike declarative knowledge, which consists of static facts, procedural knowledge is closely tied to performance and practical application. It can be refined and improved over time with experience, making it a key component in various fields where knowing how to do something is essential, such as sports, arts, and professions.

### Examples of procedural-focused disciplines and subjects

Examples include:

*   Conducting a lab experiment with technical precision (the theoretical knowledge on how the experiment should be conducted is declarative, while the skill of conducting it accurately and precisely may be procedural)
*   Driving or riding a bike
*   Cooking or baking (the theoretical knowledge of how to cook or bake a meal is declarative, while the skill of executing on the theory is procedural)
*   Study skills (the theoretical knowledge of learning principles and how techniques should be performed is declarative, while the skill of actually performing them in practice is procedural)
*   Solving mathematics or physics problems (the theoretical understanding of how to approach a problem and how different concepts can be brought together to create a solution is declarative, while the ability to actually work out the answer through calculation is procedural)
*   Speaking a language fluently or writing fluently (the vocabulary, grammar and syntax knowledge is declarative, while the skill of speaking or writing is procedural)
*   Creating an accounting balance sheet accurately and efficiently
*   Building an app or developing something with coding languages (the theoretical understanding of the language logic and syntax is declarative, while the skill in executing on it accurately and efficiently is procedural)

### The relationship between declarative and procedural knowledge

In most knowledge applications, a combination of strong declarative and procedural knowledge is essential. If someone possesses strong procedural math skills but lacks a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, they may excel at solving familiar problems but struggle with new challenges and the utilization of different math concepts.

For instance, a coder with procedural expertise may effortlessly script common functions but face difficulties with coding challenges, technical interviews, and new projects beyond their comfort zone.

Conversely, an individual with strong declarative knowledge but limited procedural skills may understand problem-solving approaches but struggle with accurate calculations.

For instance, someone with high declarative knowledge and weak procedural skills might conceptualize innovative projects but encounter issues like coding errors, bugs, inefficient practices, and reduced coding productivity.

Truly excellent learners typically excel in both domains.

### Procedural-focused Techniques:

*   **Knowledge mastery (order of learning): Lower-order**
    *   (Best for following the rules of a procedure. For example: Basic vocabulary, Applying a rule on a formula, Using the correct syntax while coding, Learning a basic function in a coding language, Following data transformation processes)
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Retrieved execution (simple)
        *   Simple flashcards
        *   Ben system
        *   Challenges (simple)
*   **Knowledge mastery (order of learning): Mid-order**
    *   (Best for basic knowledge application. For example: Basic phrases and predictable conversation in a foreign language)
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Retrieved execution (integrative)
        *   Challenges (integrative)
        *   Variable modification
*   **Knowledge mastery (order of learning): Higher-order**
    *   (Best for challenging applications. For example: Unpredictable conversations in a foreign language, Complex problem-solving in unfamiliar contexts, Creating advanced functionality and applications, Performing a series of related analyses and data transformations)
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   Retrieved execution (applied)
        *   Challenges (edge-case)
        *   Variable addition

## Explanations of Procedural Techniques

### Ben system and simple flashcards

See the explanation for these methods in the declarative section. In most scenarios, these methods are less effective than more procedurally heavy alternatives. An exception is language learning, where it is a valuable adjunct for vocabulary acquisition.

### Retrieved execution (all variations)

*   **Simple:** Retrieved execution is practising a skill or process from memory without any cue or guidance. The simple version is limited to isolated applications of the process without variation. It is often the first way to practice a new skill. However, many will continue with this simple version even after mastery. At that point, this would become REBIM (see useless techniques section) and ineffective.
*   **Integrative:** The integrative variation involves taking multiple skills and processes and bringing them together to achieve a greater or more complex function. For example, coding more complicated functions using a series of more basic functions. For languages, it may be forming common phrases and dialogues by chaining together simpler phrases. The objective is to create a more diverse application of the same knowledge to improve something called **conditional knowledge**. This is the knowledge of when and how to use your declarative and procedural knowledge.
    *   Learners should aim to move to integrative retrieved execution at the soonest possible time, immediately after gaining basic competency with simple execution. This provides stronger generative effects, greater cognitive load and more interleaving.
*   **Applied:** While integrative practice combines individual components to form a more complex product, applied practice starts with a broader project that requires multiple integrated components to make it function.
    *   Integrative starts from understanding the basic procedures and thinking about how they can be combined to form meaningful chains and sequences. Applied works backwards and starts from conceptualising a target output and thinking of how it can be achieved.
    *   In coding, this could mean developing a web application to fulfil a real need. This requires you to strategise and execute the design, implementation and QA for the application.
    *   For languages, you could think of a common scenario in which you would use your language (e.g. conversing with your friends at a mall, in German). Then, think of multiple variations of the conversations that could arise in that setting and practice each variation. Ideally, you can then test what you have practised by actually immersing in that scenario (e.g. going to a mall with your German friends).
    *   Applied retrieved execution is the most challenging but most effective form of practice. Learners should aim to move towards applied execution once they are confident with integrative execution.

### Challenges (all variations)

*   **Simple:** Challenges are similar to retrieved execution. However, challenges involve a prompt or problem stem that must be solved using your skills. Challenges can be self-created or externally provided. Simple challenges help to build basic procedural competency with simple applications. Simple challenges require simple retrieved execution.
*   **Integrative:** Integrative challenges, like integrative retrieved execution, involve combining multiple component pieces to solve a more complex problem. These challenges sometimes involve using two or more component processes or skills in ways that were previously not directly taught. A common example is solving physics or maths problems where different formulas and concepts come together to calculate a multi-step problem.
*   **Edge-case:** In edge-case challenges, the problems are centred around atypical examples of how the skills and processes can be used. They are almost always different from how the skills were originally taught, and the learner needs to think about how certain processes and skills apply in this situation. The context in which the processes need to be applied is often unfamiliar.
    *   Strong declarative knowledge of the principles is needed to navigate this. This is because declarative knowledge is a significant component of identifying valid approaches to solving the problem in the first place. Edge-case challenges may be present in hackathons or competitions. They are challenges that are so unfamiliar that most people struggle to know how to start.
    *   Fortunately, creating edge-case challenges is much easier than solving them. This is because working on solving an edge-case challenge requires in-depth knowledge of the correct approach and the procedural skill to execute. On the other hand, creating an edge-case challenge merely requires knowledge that concepts are related to each other and that they may hypothetically influence each other. Whether or not it really works is the job of the solver.
    *   This insight means we can use edge cases instead of evaluative generated questions in the advanced group method of practice tests described above in the declarative techniques section.
    *   **Protip:** Artificial intelligence can assist you in creating more complex variations of existing problems!

### Variable modification or addition

*   **Modification:** Variable modification simply means changing the variables in a given problem, challenge or question so that you can solve the same problem again with different figures. The nature of the problem is the same, and the approach is the same. This is good for practising low-level procedural skills before moving into more integrative stages of retrieval.
*   **Addition:** Variable addition involves adding variables to an existing problem, challenge or question to increase its difficulty. The variable added needs to make logical sense (therefore requiring good declarative knowledge) while also being solvable.
    *   Beneficial learning effects are generated by thinking of:
        *   which variable to add to make the problem more complicated,
        *   whether the variable makes sense,
        *   what value to give the variable in order for it to be reasonable,
        *   whether a solution actually exists when this variable is added, and
        *   evaluating how the variable interacts with other existing variables.
    *   More than one variable can be added if it is viable.
    *   For maths or physics, we can add variables by giving added contexts and conditions. For example:
        *   Adding air resistance for a mechanics question and changing the trajectory due to collision
        *   Adding a second-order differential equation and adding added initial conditions for calculus
        *   Adding limits of integration when evaluating the integral of a function
        *   Calculating the maximum volume of a cylinder but adding a surface area constraint and limiting the ratio of radius and height to 1:2
    *   For coding, we can add variables to functions and challenges, such as additional conditions. For example, time-out periods, additional user inputs, further data transformations, etc.
    *   For languages, we can add variables such as the number of speakers in a conversation, the number of viewpoints of an opinion, or the level of detail and conditions within statements or questions during a conversation. For example:
        *   "Where do you want to eat" vs.
        *   "If you're hungry, we can eat here. Otherwise, you can pick somewhere else" vs.
        *   "I've already eaten here before, but I don't mind eating here again. If you're hungry, we can eat here. Otherwise, you can pick somewhere else, as long as it tastes good."
    *   **Protip:** Artificial intelligence can assist you in creating more complex variations of existing problems!

## Example combinations

### Combination for mostly procedural knowledge

This is appropriate for people with mostly procedural requirements and minimal declarative knowledge needs.

Predominantly procedural fields have extremely simple (but effective) retrieval schedules. This is because:

1.  The skills often continually build on themselves, which causes natural consolidation and repetition.
2.  Retrieval competence is strongly related to the level of retrieval practice, error feedback, and difficulty. This means that while it can take time, the path is straightforward.
3.  Lower-order competence is directly tested with higher-order methods. This is unlike declarative knowledge where lower-order knowledge may not necessarily be tested to the same level of detail.

Therefore the basic structure of procedural-focused retrieval systems should be to simply start with the lower-order methods and progressively aim to move towards higher methods.

### Combination for mostly declarative knowledge

This is appropriate for people with primarily declarative knowledge requirements and minimal procedural needs. This is given as a guide for a comprehensive system. You do not need to follow it exactly (though you may). Where parts are not working for you, please adapt the routine based on your observations and needs.

**Interleaving Plan for Declarative Knowledge:**

*   **When:** Before first encounter with new topic
    *   **What method:** Prestudy as per program guidelines
    *   **Why:** Create big-picture framing. See articles and lessons on prestudy for further information on importance.
*   **When:** Day 1 - major learning event
    *   **What method:** Encoding as per program guidelines
    *   **Why:** This is the major learning event, such as a lecture, class, workshop, or dedicated first study session. Proper encoding is critical for establishing well-organised knowledge.
*   **When:** Day 1 - while studying or during same-day review
    *   **What method:** Simple relational teaching while studying via micro-retrieval
    *   **Why:** Micro-retrieval helps to test ourselves, even during the earliest encoding sessions. It also helps keep us from dropping into lower-order learning patterns.
*   **When:** Day 2 to 5 - first interleaved retrieval session
    *   **What method:** Brain dump (mindmap) + create simple and simple relational flashcards
    *   **Why:** Mindmap braindumps are a useful first-line retrieval method as it tests on the mid to higher-order knowledge levels. It can quickly identify big knowledge gaps and establish a reasonable foundation of knowledge. Flashcards can be created as you discover lower-order gaps.
*   **When:** Ongoing...
    *   **What method:** Reviewing simple and simple relational flashcards
    *   **Why:** Flashcards can be completed opportunistically whenever we have small gaps in time. It can help us cover our lower-order needs without dedicated retrieval sessions.
*   **When:** Day 7 to 14 - second interleaved retrieval session
    *   **What method:** Create relational and evaluative generated questions + perfect answer sheets to set up for advanced group method of practice questions.
    *   **Why:** We can build on our foundations, fill in gaps, and consolidate our knowledge by creating mid to higher-order questions. By doing so, we also create a resource for future retrieval sessions.
*   **When:** One month - third interleaved retrieval session
    *   **What method:** Collate all the generated questions we have created so far to create an an exam. Swap with a friend and answer each other's. Create a perfect answer sheet after your best attempt. Swap again as per the advanced group method instructions above.
    *   **Why:** This is an ideal time to do a large, multi-order challenge. After this, there should be much fewer knowledge gaps left.
*   **When:** Two months - fourth interleaved retrieval session
    *   **What method:** Evaluative peer/group discussion, WPW teaching (if able), or continuously repeat the advanced group method of practice testing.
    *   **Why:** As our lower-order requirements will continue to be covered by flashcards, we can finish with repeated multi-order gap testing.

### Combination for mixed knowledge types

When retrieval requirements are mixed, we recommend using a basis of the declarative combination (as declarative knowledge is often the most time-consuming and challenging to master).

For subjects/topics with a higher procedural component, swap declarative techniques for procedural techniques. Naturally, you should find that topics with a high procedural component tend to have a more minor declarative component.

The extra interleaved retrieval sessions are unnecessary in these cases, and so for those subjects, the techniques may start heavily declarative, but after gaining a high level of declarative knowledge from the initial encoding (and maybe one interleaving session), the techniques move to exclusively procedural.

In summary:

*   Use declarative methods until you have good declarative competence (this should be much faster for procedurally heavy topics). In some cases, your initial encoding alone will be sufficient for the declarative components (depending on your deep processing and encoding ability).
*   Transition to procedural methods, progressing from lower to higher order.

## FAQS

### Should I type or write out answers to questions?

In all cases, you should always generate answers fully. This can be written or typed but never just answered mentally. As the benefit of most of these retrieval methods is in the cognitive process involved, whether you type or freehand write answers does not matter. You can use whatever is faster. If the retrieval method requires drawing or mapping (e.g. chunkmaps), freehand is superior as most apps do not allow the level of freedom as freehand writing and drawing.

### Do I need to write out answers in full for practice questions?

In all cases, you should always generate answers fully. This can be written or typed but never just answered mentally. This prevents gaps caused by the illusion of explanatory depth.

### Do I need to teach out loud if using teaching methods?

It is preferred to teach out loud. While inconvenient, speaking out loud forces us to slow down and be explicit about retrieving our knowledge. This prevents gaps caused by the illusion of explanatory depth. Feel free to speak quietly to preserve your voice.

### What if I go out of scope of my curriculum?

Use your learning objectives from your curriculum (if you have one) to gauge how "out of scope" to do your retrieval. Aim to go slightly out of scope for optimal results, as staying too rigidly in the scope of your curriculum can make it harder to re-encode complex concepts.

### How accurately do I need to space out sessions?

Refer to our article on spacing here.

Generally, good quality interleaving is more important than accurate spacing. Your schedule can be off by days or even weeks as long as the quality of each session is good.

### What if I don't have enough time for all these sessions?

Do your best. As your encoding skill develops, you will retain more (making retrieval sessions faster and easier) and learn faster than the cohort (allowing you to get ahead). As an efficient system puts you ahead of the cohort schedule (if there is one), you should be able to "cram" your encoding early on so you can focus mostly on interleaved retrieval for the rest of your semester, term, or course duration.

Until your skill develops to this point, continue to do your best and fit as much interleaved retrieval as you can manage.

### For foreign language learning, I heard that I shouldn't try to speak or write anything until I feel liked I have mastered it already.

We are aware that there are some popular theories in the language learning space, especially around immersion learning and comprehensible input.

However, the popular concepts in these theories seem to be far removed from the actual research. We suspect this has occurred due to the influence of unqualified "language language gurus" who misinterpreted the research.

To our best knowledge, there is no benefit from withholding retrieved execution practice for language learning. Furthermore, it would go against most research on effective learning, including research on immersion learning and comprehensible input hypothesis itself!
