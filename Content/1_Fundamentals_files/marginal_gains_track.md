# Marginal Gains Tracking

## Anchor Your Goals

**What is your goal? (Recommended between 9 to 36 months)**

[ ]

## Dissect the Goal

**What do you need to be good at to achieve this goal?**

*   Be as specific as possible.
*   Focus on processes, not outcomes. Processes lead to outcomes and are controllable. Outcomes are symptoms of the process and we cannot directly control it.
*   Include goals about mental health, focus and concentration, time management and procrastination, study skills and how much you can retain given the time spent studying.

## Evaluate Your Level

1.  How good am I at this right now?
2.  How do I know I am this good?
3.  What condition must be true for my evaluation of my level to be accurate?
4.  What is everything I do with regards to this process? (Think of this step like an instruction manual for someone else to do exactly what you do - be as specific as possible)
5.  Is it possible that I am not as good as I think I am?
6.  If yes, what do I need to learn more about to be certain of my level?

## Find the 1%

**How can you be 1% better?**

*   Any amount of improvement is acceptable, even if it isn't technically 1%.
*   Consider improvements relating to consistency, speed, being intentional, reflecting more regularly or more critically, and especially learning more about what you need to do and experimenting with new methods.

## Reflection

**How did your experiment go? Did you get better? If not, why – and how can you change that? If yes – what made it easier or harder for you to succeed?**

This should be completed at least once per week, and ideally at the end of every day, with each day bringing a new 1% gain.
