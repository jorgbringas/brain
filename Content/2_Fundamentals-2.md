# iCanStudy Course Content: Module 2 - Fundamentals 2

*   **Pedagogical Goal:** To introduce a suite of high-yield techniques for specific contexts like exams, classes, and note-taking, building upon the foundational SIR framework from Module 1.
*   **Agent's Role:** Guide the user in integrating these powerful techniques into their established scheduling and revision practices. The agent should emphasize the expected time commitment and the significant time saved by adopting these methods.

### **Sub-Module 2.1: Advanced Study Scheduling**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management
*   **Expected time to master techniques:** 2 to 3 hours
*   **Key Points:**
    *   1 day, 1 week and 1 month is a simple guideline to follow for revision spacing. If you have a similar spacing schedule that you have learned from our previous lesson, feel free to continue using that.
    *   Use a calendar (digital or physical) to stick to a schedule where revision sessions are planned and booked out for you to commit to.
    *   Pre-study material before class to save the most amount of time overall by reducing the amount of revision needed.
    *   Schedule in pre-study and prioritise and protect this time, especially when you’re busy.
    *   **Snowball your learning** starting from learning superficially but broadly across the topic during pre-study, eventually adding more in-depth knowledge every time you study it.
*   **Technique: Easy Example Study Schedule**
    *   **Day and time - Activity - Focus while doing activity**
    *   **Sunday anytime**
        *   **Activity:** Prestudy for the week’s worth of material
        *   **Focus:** Learn just the concepts and how they relate to each other. Don’t memorise any processes, steps or definitions. Make a very basic mindmap.
    *   **End of every weekday (after learning in class)**
        *   **Activity:** Revise the day’s material
        *   **Focus:** Build a more detailed understanding of the topic. Create flashcards and elaborate on your mindmap. Don’t spend time memorising definitions or highly detailed information yet. Focus on getting a solid understanding of the concepts and a good idea of how any processes work. Don’t make flashcards for things that are conceptual.
    *   **End of every week, e.g. Friday evening or Saturday anytime**
        *   **Activity:** Revise the entire week’s worth of material
        *   **Focus:** Use an interleaved retrieval method for revision and go back in to revise any weaknesses and gaps. Now we are focused on starting to memorise details as our conceptual understanding should be very high. Teaching and making challenging questions is a good first technique.
    *   **During the week at any available pocket of time**
        *   **Activity:** Go through as many flashcards as you can, in the time you have available.
        *   **Focus:** Don’t worry about doing them all at once, just do whichever ones you can in whatever small pockets of time you can find throughout the day.
    *   **End of the month on a weekend anytime**
        *   **Activity:** Revise the entire month’s worth of material.
        *   **Focus:** This should be surprisingly easy as you have not let yourself forget much. Use another interleaved retrieval method. By now, you should have memorised most of the details via the flashcards that you have been consistently doing.
    *   **Two to three weeks before the test or exam.**
        *   **Activity:** Do more retrieval practice.
        *   **Focus:** Use another interleaved revision technique such as practice papers, challenge questions and peer quizzing. Brush up on any details that you keep forgetting.

### **Sub-Module 2.2: In-Class Technique**

*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation / Deep Processing
*   **Expected time to master techniques:** 15 hours
*   **Time wasted per month without using these techniques\*:** 15 hours
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Pre-study improves your retention, engagement and enjoyment in class.
    *   Pre-study is most effective when your focus is conceptual rather than detail-focused.
    *   Always paraphrase.
    *   Good learning feels uncomfortable and challenging as your brain is used more actively.
    *   Writing notes with mindmaps and visual or spatial representation is more effective than writing linear notes verbatim.

### **Sub-Module 2.3: Note-Taking Technique**

*   **Skill:** Deep Processing
*   **Expected time to master techniques:** 10 hours
*   **Time wasted per month without using these techniques\*:** 25 hours
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Use non-verbal and non-linear note-taking so that you manipulate knowledge through visual and spatial cortices.
    *   Start with baby steps.
    *   Look for chunks of text that can be expressed through mindmaps or images.
    *   Conceptual information is easier to represent visually than pure facts.

### **Sub-Module 2.4: Advanced Revision: Test, Target, Teach**

*   **Skill:** Retrieval / Deep Processing
*   **Expected time to master techniques:** 7 to 10 hours
*   **Technique Framework:**
    *   **Test**
        *   Apply your knowledge.
        *   Create your own questions and use pre-made questions.
        *   You can share these questions with your friends in a small study group.
        *   **Key Principle:** Creating your own challenge and exam questions can be more effective than using past papers and premade practice questions. Even if you don’t 100% know the correct answer, you gain more learning from the process of creating the question and then attempting to answer it, than you would simply answering an existing question. An over-reliance on premade questions is one reason why curveball questions throw students off so much. Good learners always use a combination of self-made and pre-made.
    *   **Target**
        *   Look for areas you feel less confident on or areas that you have not used to solve problems before.
        *   Start with areas of weakness, even if it feels uncomfortable.
    *   **Teach**
        *   Different methods of teaching change how effective it is.
        *   Don’t just “explain”. Teaching means that you change the order and way that you present the information so it makes sense for someone who hasn’t learned this before.
        *   **Teaching challenge:** An effective way to find your weaknesses is to explain why a concept is important before you introduce any terminology. This means you need to find a way to explain this in lay-terms. A common way this is explained is “teach it to a 10 year old”.
*   **Core Principle:** Every time you get something wrong or struggle, revise back to your notes and learn a little deeper than you did initially. If you forget something, it’s always best to try and see it from a new angle, increasing your chances of retaining it until next time.
*   **TASK: Implement the Test, Target, Teach Revision Cycle**
    *   **Instruction:** This is a structured, multi-week task. The agent must guide the user to schedule these distinct sessions.
    1.  **Schedule a teaching session at the end of every week.** This session should cover all the material you learned that week (at least).
    2.  **Schedule a test session one week later** where you will create your own challenge questions. This timing is flexible, but it should be around 2 to 3 weeks after your first time learning the content. **Do not answer the questions on the same day!**
    3.  **Schedule a question-answering session 1 to 2 weeks later.** This should be around 1 month after you first learned the content. At this session, answer the questions you previously made, as well as any premade questions from past papers or practice exams.

### **Sub-Module 2.5: Exam Technique**

*   **Skill:** Self-Management / Mindset
*   **Expected time to master techniques:** 20 hours
*   **Anticipated loss in exam results without using these techniques\*:** 3 to 5% or up to 10% for those with significant anxiety
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Sleep is essential for exam execution due to sleep-dependent memory consolidation.
    *   The recommended hours of sleep is at least 9 hours per night.
    *   Use priority-checking to double-check answers that you are unsure about, while maintaining an optimum pace for other questions.
    *   Think like an examiner to evaluate your knowledge and see how it can be used to solve challenging problems, especially ways that you are not confident about (i.e. make your own curveballs to protect yourself from real curveballs in the exam).
    *   Use slow, deep breathing to activate the parasympathetic response, mitigate anxiety spirals and eventually train yourself out from anxiety pathways that may have become a habit.
