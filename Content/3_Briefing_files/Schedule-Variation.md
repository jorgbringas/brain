# Example iCanStudy Schedules

## Notes about these example schedules:

*   [ ] Breaks are not specifically mentioned, but should follow the gear check guidelines.
*   [ ] Saturday and Sundays can generally be swapped, as can any of the time blocks to fit your personal needs.
*   [ ] Monthly revisions should be fit into buffer areas or replace existing revision slots.
*   [ ] Students should aim to fit regular exercise into free time and buffer areas, as well as other non-academic hobbies. These have powerful transferrable effects into academic performance, as well as providing useful long-term skills development. Students with more diverse hobbies tend to outperform in later teens and especially early to mid-twenties.
*   [ ] If you have difficulty following a low difficulty schedule, the issue may be focus or procrastination. Please see our guidelines on procrastination to overcome this. A schedule is only one part of the productivity formula.
*   [ ] If you have additional activities or tasks you need to do, simply add them into buffer areas, or rearrange the schedule utilising the flexibility provided by buffer areas.

## Not working for you? Or doesn't suit your personal situation?

If you have a schedule that does not fit into these examples, and you are unsure how to modify it to suit your needs, contact our team at iCanStudy. We will create more example schedules if many students have similar schedule types that do not work with these examples.

# KitKat - During school breaks

*   **Development speed:** S
*   **Flexibility:** S
*   **Time efficiency:** A
*   **Difficulty:** Low

*   No school
*   Very high level of flexibility
*   Modify to suit your break schedule

**Time Block: Early morning.**
    *   **5 days a week:** Morning routine
    *   **2 days a week:** Break

**Time Block: Morning/commute to school.**
    *   **5 days a week:** ICS course – learn techniques. If the techniques are simple, learn 2 or 3 at the same time. If the techniques are more complex (subjectively) or they are entire systems, learn just 1.
        *   *We are able to learn more with this schedule because we have more time to practice the techniques each day, increasing the cycle frequency of Kolb's experiential learning cycle.*
    *   **2 days a week:** Break

**Time Block: Afternoon/after school.**
    *   **5 days a week:** Apply techniques on upcoming school material (study ahead), old school work you want to revise, or any other practice material (e.g. Wikipedia for training purposes)
    *   **2 days a week:** Break

**Time Block: After dinner, early evening.**
    *   **5 days a week:** Continue applying and practising what you have learned.
    *   **2 days a week:** Break

**Time Block: Later evening.**
    *   **5 days a week:** Reflect on experience of the day. Abstract and plan experiment for next day. If at conscious competence stage and 80-90% complete, i.e. 10-20% away from unconscious competence stage, move on to learning next batch of techniques.
    *   **2 days a week:** Break

# Zombie Hunter (Add-on) – For students who fall asleep in the afternoon

*   Adapt this schedule onto any other schedule as an adjunct
*   Rearrange slots into buffer areas if needed to make it fit

*   **Flexibility:** A
*   **Difficulty:** Low

**Time Block: Early morning.**
    *   **Productive days:** Morning routine
        *   *Optional - light aerobic exercise – increases metabolism, improves day/night rhythm, reducing napping and improves night-time sleep.*
        *   *Avoid foods high in carbohydrates or or fats – this increases sleepiness after eating due to increase shunting of blood to the digestive system, taking blood away from the brain.*
    *   **Rest days:** Break

**Time Block: Morning.**
    *   **Productive days:** Flexible - as per other schedules
    *   **Rest days:** Break

**Time Block: Afternoon/after school.**
    *   **Productive days:** When feeling sleepy, choose a 20-minute activity which primarily keeps you awake. If you choose to study in a way that feels more active, you may still fall asleep, causing productivity to be zero. If you instead choose to go for a run and somehow make it productive, you will definitely not fall asleep, and get at least some benefit. Over time, you will train out the napping behaviour that has become an afternoon habit.
        *   *Recommended: Going for a walk outside, mental mindmapping with a note-book; some form of physical activity, potentially with a friend while quizzing or teaching each other; going for a jog while listening to teaching recordings.*
    *   **Rest days:** Break

**Time Block: After dinner.**
    *   **Productive days:** Flexible
    *   **Rest days:** Break

**Time Block: Later evening.**
    *   **Productive days:** As per other schedules. Incorporate a wind-down routine. Day-time sleepiness is often due to inadequate quantity or quality/depth of sleep at night (which napping makes even worse).
        *   *Recommended routine: 10 minutes of journaling to get stray thoughts out and reflect, followed by 10 to 15 minutes of guided meditation with an app like Calm (or their YouTube channel).*
    *   **Rest days:** Night-time sleep routine keeping consistency of sleep even on your "off days" reduces "social jet lag", which negatively impacts your sleep cycles on other days.
