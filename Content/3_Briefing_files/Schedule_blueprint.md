# Easy example study schedule

## Notes about this example schedule:

*   If the volume of work is high, you can add another revision session in the middle of the month as a fortnightly review, or a mid-week as a 2-day review.
*   Any of the specific days on this schedule can be modified to suit your needs, as long as it follows the same order. For example, you can do your prestudy on a Saturday, or a Monday morning. You can do 2 weeks' worth of prestudy in one go instead of 1 week. In later lessons we will develop your ability to prestudy one entire topic (4-6 weeks) in one go.
*   Time spent on revision reduces as your prestudy technique grows. We will learn several techniques to massively boost your first-pass retention in other lessons that can reduce the time spent on revision by 300-500%.

**Day and time: Sunday anytime**
*   **Activity:** Prestudy for the week's worth of material
*   **Focus while doing activity:** Learn just the concepts and how they relate to each other. Don't memorise any processes, steps or definitions. Make a very basic mindmap.

**Day and time: End of every weekday (after learning in class)**
*   **Activity:** Revise the day's material
*   **Focus while doing activity:** Build a more detailed understanding of the topic. Create flashcards and elaborate on your mindmap. Don't spend time memorising definitions or highly detailed information yet. Focus on getting a solid understanding of the concepts and a good idea of how any processes work. Don't make flashcards for things that are conceptual.

**Day and time: End of every week, e.g. Friday evening or Saturday anytime**
*   **Activity:** Revise the entire week's worth of material
*   **Focus while doing activity:** Use an interleaved retrieval method for revision and go back in to revise any weaknesses and gaps. Now we are focused on starting to memorise details as our conceptual understanding should be very high. Teaching and making challenging questions is a good first technique.

**Day and time: During the week at any available pocket of time**
*   **Activity:** Go through as many flashcards as you can, in the time you have available.
*   **Focus while doing activity:** Don't worry about doing them all at once, just do whichever ones you can in whatever small pockets of time you can find throughout the day.

**Day and time: End of the month on a weekend anytime**
*   **Activity:** Revise the entire month's worth of material.
*   **Focus while doing activity:** This should be surprisingly easy as you have not let yourself forget much. Use another interleaved retrieval method. By now, you should have memorised most of the details via the flashcards that you have been consistently doing.

**Day and time: Two to three weeks before the test or exam.**
*   **Activity:** Do more retrieval practice.
*   **Focus while doing activity:** Use another interleaved revision technique such as practice papers, challenge questions and peer quizzing. Brush up on any details that you keep forgetting.
