# Experience, Reflection, Abstraction, and Experimentation Log

## Experience

*   I have tried chunking by importance and making my map less process-driven and I have noticed that the flow is not very inherent and I don't know where to start to fix it
*   Inbetween experience

## Reflection

*   **How did you feel?**
    *   A bit confused and worried, especially for the fact that I am starting to consider that this will be a big issue for when I start uni if I cannot get this knocked down.
    *   Also uneasy, looking at the map can sometimes cause me to go down this negative spiral where I see that I might have messed up something with the chunking like reverse causality and this causes me to think that I'm not following the course correctly because I'm not cut out for it, this is something though that I have done a kolbs on for straying from this mindset.
    *   Also worried a bit about my retention on my maps, I'm starting to worry that my retention has gone down when compared to the maps I did during year 12 and I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that I am trying to alter my technique for the better or because I'm not practicing quality spacing interleaving and retrieval often due to the fact that I'm learning this right now for fun and skill development.
    *   When looking at the map, I see that there is still a lot more to cover (and I reckon that this is due to how the topic I'm looking at has no boundaries) and this causes me to treat the map as particularly poor quality and effort, when I have consistently been trying to improve. Overall, now I feel pretty bad about how the map looks at this point, it does not seem too good for what I was expecting.
    *   Eventually, I would always come back to remembering the past and how I have grown from my maps being consistently process driven and little importance based. I would feel proud of how I have gotten at least 1% better with my chunking and recognise that I need to do more reflection, however, this still causes me to stray from the idea that I need to focus on improving this technique and have not really done that much focus on making the flow very inherent.

*   **When did you feel this way?**
    *   Mainly after my work session and when I am just looking on the map without doing any intentional work on it. It's almost like I can't feel positive about the map when not doing any intentional work on it.
    *   It is only when I recognise previous maps and see how much more process driven they were do I feel a bit better. This has me realise that I'm on the path to making the map be inherent with a bit more regular reflection, abstraction and experimentation.

*   **If you struggled, at what points? Were there any triggers?**
    *   The only time I'd really struggle with the chunking of the map would be when I'd realise that it was not process driven and my chunks were not having 2 arrows coming off of them.
        *   This would cause me to then ask why is it important to find more reasons for importance - this would require a teeny bit more brain work.
    *   Additionally, I'd only really seem to struggle when not looking at the map during my work sessions. Looking at the map with my hands kind of tied allowed me to view the map pretty subjectively rather than objectively to see where I have grown and what to improve in.

*   **How did you react?**
    *   When seeing that my chunking job was not very inherent, I would be tossing up with whether to do a kolb's cycle on it or just try and 'make it inherent' without knowing exactly how to. This would further have me get pretty worked up; I didn't know what to do or what I'd be missing out on by either option.
    *   When I would think that I have done a terrible effort, I would not instantly dismiss this, I would still consider it however, feel glad for how I have improved on my mindmapping ability and chunking by importance.
    *   Ultimately, when looking at my mindmap and seeing the issues in regards to the chunking and flow not being inherent, this was where I would tie my hands behind my back and go back into my comfort zone and would not do anything about it, particularly due to the fact that I would be looking at the map when I was not intentionally meant to be working on it. This caused me to think that I need to get better and feel that the only way was through kolb's (ignoring the fact that I had not done enough playing around yet)

*   **How did you feel before, during and after the event?**
    *   **Before:** Somewhat eager to test out the recommendations Justin gave me and the experiments I had gotten through kolb's. I was feeling that this would hit the nail on the head, have me improve in nearly all aspects.
    *   **During:** Happy that the map was becoming more and more importance driven, not process driven, this was an improvement.
    *   **After:** a bit sad that the flow was not inherent, and that all my issues were not fixed after one kolbs despite me knowing that a single kolb's would not fix it. This caused me to remember that continual reflection would lead me to the solution, causing me to happily ignore how I needed more experience with making the flow to be able to improve better; my perfectionism came out.

## Abstraction

*   **How do I tend to act in these kinds of situations?**
    *   When a single kolbs does not fix all of my issues, I forget that the purpose of the kolb's cycle should be to get 1% better each time and that a minute improvement is alright. It takes me a while to reflect on the situation and the work I have done to realise this
    *   When I notice that something is not as good as it should be and that I need to improve, I immediately turn to kolb's without recognising that a bit more experience with trying to do anything with the technique would be better. I wait for everything to be perfect and aligned for me to embark on the new challenge or technique.
    *   (Continues from page 2) task/challenge as an investment rather than a loss, I tend to be loss aversed when it comes to new challenges and don't view it as okay for the fact that I might waste time getting some experience on my hands with a new skill.
    *   With my growth mindset, when I feel a bit discouraged by my performance, I forget to look back on where I used to be to view the growth in my skill level.

*   **What about my approach or perspective or overall strategy made me prone to making this Error?**
    *   I disregard the idea that I need more experience and instead turn to kolb's when I don't really have that much experience. Essentially, I want everything to be perfect before trying something new.
    *   Regarding my growth mindset, and when I am not happy with my progress, I do not look on what I have achieved to remind myself that failure is inevitable and will be overcome through experimentation (provided that I have gotten my hands dirty enough first)

*   **Do I make similar mistakes in other areas as well?**
    *   With engaging in new activities and challenges like skateboarding, I tend to wait and wait looking for advice online without sensibly diving into the task and regularly reflecting on the experiences at hand. I have a bit of a fear of wasting time, money or resources when it comes to embarking on new challenges and improving without considering this as an investment.

*   **What habits do I seem to have in certain types of situations that make me behave, react or act in this way?**
    *   I do not consider the time, money and resources spent before engaging in a new

## Experimentation

*   Next time, when trying a new skill, activity or task, I will set out time that I will be willing to lose for the true purpose of gaining experience that will allow me to improve in the task (with kolbs)
*   When I am tossing up between doing a kolb's cycle or gaining a bit more experience with the skill at hand, I will then do one 50 minute session getting some more experience to suffice that for a kolb's cycle
*   When I have done some mapping and am not happy with the state of the map despite me trying to work on my skills, I will remember to look back on my previous attempts at that skill to purposefully look for areas in which I have grown in
