| **How informed are you about the specific requirements and difficulty to achieve your short-term and long-term goals?**<br/>Do you know the specific details around what it takes for you to reach your goals consistently, including skill level. | Very high level of specific information  | Some information, but not very specific  | General idea only, without much specific information |
| **How much training and education have you undergone with regards to studying skills, time management and productivity?**<br/>High levels include courses by qualified sources (senior students or YouTube gurus *generally* lack qualification). Lower levels include occasional resources or videos, including from unqualified sources. Very low levels of training include discussion with friends or just general exposure. | High level of consistent training from qualified and reliable sources | Lower level of training, more intentional and consistent than just general exposure | Very low level of training, or only general exposure to these topics |

Differences between section 3 and section 4 indicate a **high chance** that your confidence is biased. The danger is that these biases are so strong that despite evidence that the level of confidence may be unfounded, only very open-minded students are able to accept this. Think about anti-vaxers or climate change denialists â€“ high confidence, very fixed, and virtually no training.
