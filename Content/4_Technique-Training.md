# iCanStudy Course Content: Module 4 - Technique Training

*   **Pedagogical Goal:** To introduce and integrate variations of inquiry-based learning, moving the user beyond foundational techniques to a more organic, effective, and brain-friendly system. The central technique of this module is the Traffic Light System (TLS).
*   **Agent's Role:** Guide the user through the new core theories and the practical application of the Traffic Light System. The Agent must ensure the user understands how this new framework integrates all previously learned techniques (like Collecting/Processing and Revision Basics) and must enforce the Mid-Checkpoint practice cycle before the user can complete the stage.

### **Sub-Module 4.1: Core Theories of Organic Learning**

*   **Skill:** Mindset / Deep Processing
*   **Theory 1: Cave Theory**
    *   Our brain is the same as it has been since caveman times but modern learning has become very artificial. This creates a disconnect between our brain and the way we learn today, which leaves many people learning in very inefficient ways. Cave theory tells us that we need to learn in the best way the brain was designed for in order for learning to be more organic and enjoyable. We will see how the cave theory applies to many aspects of the BHS techniques, as well as other, even more advanced time management techniques! (BHS = Bear Hunter System).
*   **Theory 2: Memory, Forgetting, and the "Survive and Thrive" Filter**
    *   **What does it mean to have a “good memory”?** A good memory means that you have good retention. Memory is stored in your brain, not in a box, but as individual nodes of information that are linked to one another. Memories that particularly pertain to surviving and thriving are stored more readily as your brain recognises it as important and, from cave theory, the consequences of forgetting would be a threat to survival.
    *   **Recall is about relationships:** When we recall memory, we actually find all the related memory nodes and reconstruct the memory from scratch. More memorable memories are those that connect many different related nodes, which is why it is more readily recallable compared to memories that have very few memory nodes. This building of structure is called **conceptual learning** and it is what we will be mainly focusing on. Learning without any structure is **rote learning**, which is trying to blindly memorise something again and again, which is very weak compared to conceptual learning.
    *   **The Survive and Thrive Filter:** Anytime we learn anything new, we put it through this Survive and Thrive filter in order to connect the information and increase retention. Learning new information is most effective when we immediately try to problem solve with it as opposed to thinking it’s an individual, unrelated, and purposeless piece of information. We need to make it as relevant as possible to solve real or made-up problems in our lives.
    *   **Principle:** Our brain adapts to solve problems and learn things along the way. Our brain does **NOT** learn things first and then try to solve problems in two separate steps.
*   **Theory 3: System 1 and System 2 Thinking (Extra for experts - optional)**
    *   This split in the way our brain thinks has been noted in lots of research, including Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. He identified two systems of thinking, one fast and reactive – based on pattern recognition, and one slow and deliberate.
    *   **The hot-cold empathy gap:** This is also seen in hot vs cold decision making where we tend to make different decisions when under pressure or stimulated (hot) than when we are cold and calculating.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is a very ingrained way of thinking. When we study, we can actually make use of this and turn one of our brains greatest natural (unavoidable) tendencies and exploit it to our advantage. The way we do this is by making sure the information we take in is problem-oriented from the onset, and pattern-seeking.

### **Sub-Module 4.2: Inquiry-Based Learning & The Traffic Light System (TLS)**

*   **Skill:** Deep Processing / Self-Regulation
*   **Concept: Inquiry-based learning:** Creating problems and then answering these problems dictates what we consume and how we think about things. This process of seeking an answer and being curious, followed by satiating that curiosity, is called ‘inquiry-based learning’. We base our learning on asking questions about creating and solving problems. Studying only produces learning when the information you consume has a purpose. And problems give purpose.
*   **Concept: Conventional vs. Inquiry-Based Learning:** Conventional learning causes you to learn too much information at once, which makes things harder to process because of its unfocused nature. This causes learners to quickly forget the information. It’s like throwing a bunch of items into a room, then realising you don’t know where anything is, so taking it all out and organising it again. The better approach would have been to organise it first!
*   **The Core Technique: The Traffic Light System (TLS)**
    *   **Principle:** To start implementing inquiry-based learning we can train our brain using the traffic light system. **Continue to use the collecting and processing way of writing notes when performing this! You never want to go back to just passive linear note-taking ever again.**
    *   **The Method:**
        1.  **RED (Stop & Question):**
            *   Grab all your study material and ask yourself what you are curious about the topic.
            *   What questions can you make? What problems can you solve? Where can you apply this?
            *   *Note to Agent: Reassure the user: At the beginning, don’t try to make perfect questions. It is very normal to struggle with asking questions, which is perfectly fine, but you need to continue asking them in order to improve and benefit from this task.*
        2.  **GREEN (Hunt for Answers):**
            *   Go and answer those questions, learning the topic in a very organic way. Don’t read everything trying to memorise all the information. Instead, focus on naturally answering the questions you have asked.
            *   When answering questions, try to process multiple answers into a single, condensed set of notes. You may need to answer each individually as a collecting step, but we want to start thinking about how the answers are related to each other and how the topic is inter-connected. You can often find many chunks by doing this – which you should then express through your processed notes.
            *   *Note to Agent: Encourage the user: Feel free to give mindmapping a go – even if you get it wrong, we will work on your technique in later stages anyway, so it doesn’t matter if you don’t do it perfectly. Your experience at trying and failing will speed up your development significantly in later stages.*
        3.  **CYCLE:**
            *   Then you go back to Red and ask more questions. Because you have more knowledge after answering your questions on the green light, this enables you to ask more specific or different kinds of questions about the topic than you could at first.
            *   Keep switching green to red to green to red in order to thoroughly understand the topic.

### **Sub-Module 4.3: Order Control**

*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
*   **Concept:** One of the key differences you will notice about inquiry-based learning compared to conventional learning is the order in which information is gathered. Traditionally, we learn from a textbook from the start to the end but this is a very artificially fixed way of learning that does not take into account what you already know and are interested in. Order control is finding the best order for us to learn new information and is based on the questions we ask ourselves before consuming information, for example, during the red light of the traffic-light system.
*   **Principle:** In summary, embrace learning things in a different order from the textbook or class because the questions you ask during the traffic-light system will help you find the right order for you to learn.
*   **Addressing Fears:** At the beginning of order control, people find it scary to learn things in a different order to what is given in the textbook. They feel that they will learn too little because they are skipping paragraphs and it is very chaotic, or they are scared of wasting time by learning too much “irrelevant” material.
*   **The Swiss Cheese Model Analogy:** The iCanStudy system will foolproof the learning process so that you won’t miss out on information. In the later stages, we will learn about powerful revision strategies that stop anything from slipping through the cracks. The swiss cheese model shows that it’s really hard to miss information because you are revisiting and asking questions in several rounds. Alternatively, if you learn linearly it is actually much easier to miss things as our brain is not a photocopy machine and will miss many points with conventional linear learning.

### **Sub-Module 4.4: Technique Training – Mid Checkpoint**

*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
*   **Action: Practice Time!** This is a mandatory practice and reflection point in the module.
*   **Core Concept:** At this current stage, there are a few techniques that should be coming together. This is a common sticking point for many students. Competence is required with:
    *   You are aware of how to process notes
    *   You are familiar with grouping information into chunks
    *   You have a basic understanding of self-facilitated inquiry-based learning
    *   You know how to use the Traffic Light System (TLS) to create curiosity and improve your question quality over time through repeated Kolb’s experiential learning cycles
*   **The Recommended Practice Cycle:**
    1.  **Practice:** the TLS for two or three different topics.
    2.  **Self-Feedback:** Do some self-feedback and reflection on: Your note-taking, Your question-quality, Your grouping/chunking.
    3.  **Learn:** After you have done this for two or three topics, head to the Spot the Issues challenges in the Member’s Area to complete one or two related to the “Briefing the TT” stage.
    4.  **Experiment:** Take some key learnings from there and practice on another two topics.
    5.  **Iterate:** Go back to the Spot the Issues and continue this cycle of practice, reflection, learning and experimentation until you feel more comfortable.
*   **Final Gate:** The Agent must convey this instruction: "If you feel like you’re reaching a plateau or you just aren’t getting the results that we’re saying you should be getting, send in your work for expert feedback. You can continue progressing through the course while you work on this, but **don’t finish the stage until you reach a level of competence with this stack of techniques.** And remember to ask me (the agent) if you need help."
