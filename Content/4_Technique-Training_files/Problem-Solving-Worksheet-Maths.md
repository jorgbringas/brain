# Problem Solving Worksheet: Never Make the Same Mistake Again

*Worksheet by iCanStudy Student Louis Huynh, contribution by Derrick Mah*

## Important note

Be as specific as you can be. The more specific you are, the better you can fix your issues and NEVER. MAKE. THE SAME. MISTAKE.

## Why is this important?

We have the notion that doing questions over and over again will make us better and improve our grade. While true in a sense, the students who ace their math exams can solve problems within the time limit and 100% accuracy. Not only this, but some top students seemingly spend significantly less time focusing on maths and more on other subjects such as chemistry, biology, digital solutions, history etc.

So, what's the trick? What's the life hack? Just be born smart? No. The answer is simple. They have a deep understanding of the topic and do not need to spend time doing 100 variations of a question asking for the same thing. Instead, they just need to do 5.

Having a deep understanding of a topic is a whole different ballpark but if you want to see tangible results and save more time, then here is a basic guideline in never making the same mistake.

After a while, you find that you start automatically asking these questions when you get a question wrong. At that point, you can refrain from having to use this worksheet.

## Examples

### Example 1: Unit 3 Exam revision Question set 4, question 4, CF
*   **Kind of mistake:** To find the maximum rate of change, I calculated the x-intercept of the derivative.
*   **Why mistake:** I mistook finding the maximum rate of change with stationary point.
*   **How to ensure not again:** Firstly, I need to understand that "maximum rate" implies calculating the derivative, which is the rate of change at any given point on a curve. To find the maximum rate, I have to calculate the maximum turning point of the derivative function because that is the highest rate. The x-intercept of a derivative graph means that the rate of change is 0. Alternatively, I could find the derivative of the derivative and its x-intercept for the same value.

### Example 2: Sometimes, you can come up with your own questions
*   **Kind of mistake:** I used the circumference of a circle instead of the area of a circle to find the shaded area
*   **Why mistake:** I was thinking about the previous question, which asked for circumference. I wasn't in the correct mindset due to misinterpreting the word "shaded area". This was due to a lack of logic regarding what the question was asking me for.
*   **How to ensure not again:** Next time I will write out the whole formula from the formula booklet and double-check whether the formula I wrote out helps me answer the question. I can also visually shade the area that I want (i.e. whole circle - sector).

### Example 3: You will find that you get used to this column more quickly than others.
*   **Kind of mistake:** I incorrectly identified the interior angle of the bearing as 30 degrees instead of 50 degrees. The question said the true bearing was 050, but I measured the 50 degrees from the 90-degree line instead of true north.
*   **Why mistake:** I had poor logic in understanding how bearings work, as I didn't measure the interior angle in various ways.
*   **How to ensure not again:** Next time double-check the value of the interior angle by first drawing the true bearing and then finding the complimentary angle from that.
