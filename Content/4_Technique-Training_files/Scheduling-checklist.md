# Scheduling Checklist

In the beginning, you may start by setting weekly priorities. Eventually, you want to transition to daily priorities. After determining your priorities, make sure to set your schedule the night before.

*   [ ] Ensure to schedule your top two priority items first.
*   [ ] For scheduling (not necessarily for prioritisation), you may like to use a diary or an app.
    *   Diaries have a pen and paper feel that people may enjoy. An app has more features and is more portable/accessible and easier to reorganise if something happens during the day. For most people with busy schedules, apps are more efficient.
*   [ ] Be very specific in your scheduling entries. To avoid procrastination, break down your study time into 30-minute blocks. Don't overschedule though! Still leave breaks and gaps.
*   [ ] Overestimate the time required to complete a task by 25%.
*   [ ] Underfill your day by 25%. Have 15-minutes between each task. Have 30-minutes to 1-hour of your day free as unscheduled.
*   [ ] Overestimation and underfilling can be readjusted to suit you after you have practised the scheduling at these initial "safety-margin" percentages.
*   [ ] Near the end of each day, ensure that you schedule yourself the time to set priorities and schedule for the next day.
