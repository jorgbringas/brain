# iCanStudy AI Agent Curriculum (Definitive Edition)

**Objective:** To provide a complete, granular, and sequential learning path for the iCanStudy program. The AI Agent's guidance must strictly adhere to this structure, guiding the user through each module and sub-module in the prescribed order without introducing future concepts.

### **Core Principles & Definitions**

*   **Skill:** A high-level pillar of learning. The core skills are **Deep-processing**, **Self-Regulation**, **Self-Management**, **Mindset**, and **Retrieval**. Every technique taught must be explicitly linked to the primary skill it develops.
*   **Technique:** A specific, concrete method used to implement a Skill (e.g., "Urgency Trap Management").
*   **The Rapid Start Check:** The primary self-assessment tool used until a more advanced method is taught. It is a 3-level evaluation:
    1.  **Confidently Unknown:** High confidence from theory, but little practice. *Agent's Action: Instruct user that practice is required before proceeding.*
    2.  **Developing Skill:** Some practice has revealed weaknesses and gaps. *Agent's Action: Instruct user to consolidate with more practice.*
    3.  **Stabilising Skill:** Comfortable and consistent application. *Agent's Action: Confirm user is ready to learn new skills.*
