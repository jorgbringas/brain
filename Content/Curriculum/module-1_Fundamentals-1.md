## **Module 1: Fundamentals 1**

*   **Pedagogical Goal:** To introduce the core theoretical framework of the primary practice skills: Spacing, Interleaving, and Retrieval (SIR). This module provides a comprehensive mental model to prepare the user for the intensive practice in the 30-Day Plan.
*   **Agent's Role:** Present each sub-module's concepts and tasks in the exact order below. Ensure the user has a general understanding of the SIR framework before proceeding to the 30-Day Plan.

### **Sub-Module 1.1: The Problem with Studying**
*   **Skill:** Mindset / Self-Regulation
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   Study systems built only on spaced retrieval (repetition) are no longer sufficient.
    *   Techniques that change the *slope of the forgetting curve* (i.e., improve encoding) are more effective than simple repetition.
    *   **Recognising when we are on Mt. Stupid (Dunning-Kruger Effect):** We are often most confident about things we know very little about. This can cause us to reject the advice we need most.
*   **Technique: Confidence Assessment**
    *   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
    *   To check if you are on Mt. Stupid, ask yourself two questions:
        1.  Do you have a high level of confidence in your current method/knowledge?
        2.  Have you spent enough time learning about the alternatives to be considered a professional?
    *   If the answer is "yes" to 1 and "no" to 2, you are likely on Mt. Stupid and must be open to new advice.

### **Sub-Module 1.2: Marginal Gains**
*   **Skill:** Mindset / Self-Regulation
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Consistency > Sudden Bursts:** Small, consistent efforts compound and produce a greater total effect than occasional, intense efforts.
    *   **Stacking Gains:** Starting imperfectly *now* is better than starting perfectly later because it allows gains to compound.
    *   **Positive vs. Negative Gains:**
        *   **Positive Gains:** 1% improvements that build on each other, leading to exponential progress.
        *   **Fluctuating Gains:** Inconsistent efforts that do not compound, leading to stagnation and burnout.
        *   **Negative Gains:** Worsening skills due to a lack of reliable information or feedback.
    *   **Key Principle:** Marginal gains create *safety of success*. Big jumps sacrifice this safety for an unlikely boost.
*   **Technique: Tracking Marginal Gains**
    *   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
    *   **Key Concept:** The brain is terrible at tracking small, gradual changes. Actively tracking marginal gains is one of the only ways to visualize progress and create a **positive motivation cycle** (Intention -> Action -> Visible Outcome -> Positive Reinforcement). Not tracking them leads to a **demotivation spiral**.
*   **Task: Identify your marginal gains for learning efficiently**
    1.  Identify a marginal gain.
    2.  Try to reach it.
    3.  Reflect on the experience.
    4.  Identify the *next* marginal gain with a 5-step framework.
    5.  Repeat this process twice (for a total of three compounded gains).

### **Sub-Module 1.3: Spacing, Interleaving, and Retrieval (SIR)**
*   **Skill:** Retrieval / Deep Processing
*   **Key Concept: Encoding vs. Retrieval.** They are two sides of the learning coin. High-quality encoding reduces the need for retrieval, but retrieval practice is **still necessary** for a complete study system to combat natural forgetting.
*   **Important Note about training SIR:** SIR is a method, not a single technique. Its difficulty depends on the retrieval techniques used. Retrieval techniques are generally easier to master (3-5 hours) than encoding techniques.

#### **1.3.1) Spacing Tips**
*   **Skill:** Self-Management
*   **Principle:** Space your retrieval sessions to the point where you are **just starting to forget** the material. Too frequent is redundant; too infrequent is inefficient.
*   **Technique: Spacing Interval Guidelines (Expanding-Gap)**
    *   Learn something for the first time.
    *   **Review:** Later the same day.
    *   **Next review:** 2 or 3 days later.
    *   **Next review:** 5 to 10 days later.
    *   **Next review:** 10 to 20 days later.
    *   **Next review:** 1 to 2 months later.
*   **Technique: Recommended Practical Schedule**
    *   Revise on the **same day** you learned it.
    *   Do a **mid-week revision** of the previous 2 days' content (optional for smaller workloads).
    *   Do an **end-of-week revision** for the entire week's content.
    *   Do an **end-of-month revision** for the entire month's content.
    *   Revise for the entire test/exam 1-2 weeks before the assessment.

#### **1.3.2) Interleaving Tips**
*   **Skill:** Retrieval / Deep Processing
*   **Principle:** Review information from **multiple angles and perspectives.** This protects you from "curveball" exam questions.
*   **Key Concept: Expertise.** The goal is to develop an expert's "knowledge network." This is built through higher-order learning, not just memorization.
*   **Technique: Understanding Different Interleaving Techniques**
    *   **Skill:** Retrieval / Self-Regulation
    *   A list of examples to choose from:
        *   Teach an imaginary student.
        *   Draw a mindmap.
        *   Draw an image instead of using words.
        *   Answer practice questions.
        *   Create your own challenging test questions.
        *   Create a test question in a real-world context.
        *   Modify a difficult question you found.
        *   Form a study group and quiz each other.

#### **1.3.3) Retrieval Tips**
*   **Skill:** Retrieval
*   **Principle:** Retrieval means taking information from long-term memory and bringing it into working memory. No learning system is complete without it.
*   **Technique: Dedicated Retrieval Sessions**
    *   **Tip 1:** Donâ€™t look at your notes within at least 12 hours of the session.
    *   **Tip 2:** Always generate a full answer, even if you are unsure.
    *   **Tip 3:** Practice retrieving information *fully* as if you were being assessed.
*   **Technique: Micro-Retrieval (During study/class)**
    *   **Tip 1:** **Never write any notes before you have processed the information mentally first.**
    *   **Tip 2:** When you do write, always try to write from memory first before referring back to your notes.
    *   **Tip 3:** Avoid writing in full sentences. Stick to keywords, doodles, arrows, and lines.

### **Sub-Module 1.4: Recommended Tasks for Fundamentals 1**
*   **Task 1:** Write down a plan of what changes you will make to your revision or note-taking in class/while studying to maximize retrieval.
*   **Task 2:** Pick at least 3 interleaving techniques and plan to use them in your spaced revision sessions.
*   **Task 3: Create a one-month SIR schedule.** Using the guidelines, schedule your retrieval sessions for the next month. You must **complete at least the first week** before marking this task as complete.

### **Sub-Module 1.5: Quiz - SIR Checkpoint**
*   **Skill:** Self-Regulation
*   **Action:** The Agent will administer a quiz with scenario-based questions (like Michael the programming student, Gabriella the biology major, Steve the medical student) to check the user's conceptual understanding of how to apply SIR principles to different types of knowledge (procedural vs. declarative).
